<i>"Winner, winner,
chicken dinner."</i>

2
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:46,253
<i>Those words had been dancing
around my head all night.</i>

3
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:49,630
<i>I mean, it's Vegas lore,
that phrase.</i>

4
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:53,836
<i>Just ask any of the old-time
pit bosses, they'll know.</i>

5
00:00:57,075 --> 00:01:01,512
<i>It was a Chinese dealer at Binion's
who was first credited with the line.</i>

6
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,249
<i>He would shout it every time
he dealt blackjack.</i>

7
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,808
<i>That was over 40 years ago,
and the words still catch.</i>

8
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,911
<i>Winner, winner, chicken dinner.
There it is!</i>

9
00:01:11,022 --> 00:01:13,388
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."</i>

10
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:15,992
<i>Yeah, try it.</i>

11
00:01:18,263 --> 00:01:21,255
<i>I had heard it at least
14 times that night.</i>

12
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:23,491
<i>I couldn't lose.</i>

13
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:27,670
<i>First of all, what
I was doing wasn't illegal.</i>

14
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:31,002
<i>There were certain institutions
and people that frowned upon it,</i>

15
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:33,270
<i>but it's legal.</i>

16
00:01:33,378 --> 00:01:35,141
<i>And not everyone can do it.</i>

17
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:37,407
<i>Just those with gifted minds.</i>

18
00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:39,547
<i>I have a gifted mind.</i>

19
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:42,679
<i>That's what got me
into all this mess.</i>

20
00:01:43,254 --> 00:01:48,282
<i>I was counting cards
and I was up over 640,000 dollars.</i>

21
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:53,153
All right! I'm just gonna have
to split those tens.

22
00:01:53,264 --> 00:01:55,994
- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens again.

23
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:58,069
Well, that's all right.
I've been winning and losing for years.

<i>We used hand signals, too.</i>

<i>A touch to the eye,
we need to talk.</i>

27
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:11,875
<i>And a hand, running through
perfect flowing hair, meant only one thing.</i>

00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,211

TA to Professors Wilkins
and Sanders.

Both of whom are friends of mine,
and who wrote glowing recommendations.

38
00:05:19,037 --> 00:05:22,063
And you're accepted early into school
here at Harvard Med,

39
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:25,108
pending graduation from MIT.
It's very impressive.

40
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:26,176
Thank you.

41
00:05:26,277 --> 00:05:29,508
The Robinson Scholarship
is comprehensive, as you know.

42
00:05:29,614 --> 00:05:33,050
It's a free ride. And
free rides don't come easy.

43
00:05:33,151 --> 00:05:34,140
Absolutely.

44
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:39,349
We have 76 applicants this year,
only one of whom will get the scholarship

45
00:05:39,457 --> 00:05:43,052
and most of whom have résumés
just as impressive as yours.

46
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:45,155
Right.

47
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:47,925
Uh, Professor Phillips?

48
00:05:48,118 --> 00:05:52,135
Uh, some kids... grow up
wanting to play for the Red Sox.

49
00:05:52,236 --> 00:05:56,195
You know, some grow up wanting to be,
I don't know, a fireman.

50
00:05:56,741 --> 00:06:01,701
I grew up, uh... Well, really, I just
wanted to come here to Harvard Med.

51
00:06:02,814 --> 00:06:08,411
And now that I've gotten accepted,
it seems to only come down to the money.

52
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:11,578
Which I don't really have.

53
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:17,587
So, what-what I'm trying to say

54
00:06:17,695 --> 00:06:22,029
is that I really, really
need this scholarship.

55
00:06:24,736 --> 00:06:26,465
Did you rehearse that?

56
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:29,938
Yeah. Like, 14 times
in front of the mirror.

57
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:34,976
Unfortunately, desire
doesn't figure into this much.

58
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:40,215
The Robinson is going
to go to someone who...

59
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:42,981
dazzles.

60
00:06:44,122 --> 00:06:47,614
Somebody who just...
jumps off the page.

61
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:52,528
Oh, well, then, uh, I'm also
involved in a science competition.

62
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,359
We're building a robotic wheel

63
00:06:54,465 --> 00:06:58,663
that can navigate itself, uh,
using a proprietary GPS system.

64
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:02,871
Well, I'm designing
the system. So...

65
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:04,100
Right.

66
00:07:04,642 --> 00:07:08,043
Ben, last year, the Robinson
went to Hyum Jae Wook,

67
00:07:08,146 --> 00:07:11,115
a Korean immigrant
who has only one leg.

68
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,313
Well, I-I have both my legs.

69
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,548
Well, have you considered
cutting one of them off?

70
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,415
That was a joke.

71
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,327
Ben, it's all about the essay.

72
00:07:24,429 --> 00:07:27,421
You need to really explain to us
what makes you special.

73
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:30,865
What life experience separates
you from all the rest.

74
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,461
Life experience.

75
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:36,268
What can you tell me, Ben,

76
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:39,002
that's going
to dazzle me?

77
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:04,859
I'm so sorry
I'm late.

78
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:08,234
- Where is your jacket?
- Oh, I got it. I got it. It's right here.

79
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:11,900
This is no way for the new
assistant manager to come to work.

80
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:15,410
Congratulations.
How does 8 dollars an hour sound?

81
00:08:15,513 --> 00:08:16,980
Eight dollars?

82
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:22,350
Wow! Wow. That's-that's great,
Warren. Thank you. Thank you.

83
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:26,251
You slept with him,
didn't you?

84
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,586
- Uhh, yes, I did.
- Yes, you did.

85
00:08:27,586 --> 00:08:32,010
- Yes, I did.
- I'll sleep with him, too, and I'll get $8 an hour.

86
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:35,291
So, Palmer finishes up his lecture,
right? And I say to him,

87
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,130
" Well, Professor Palmer, you're gonna need
at least 14 capacitance probes

88
00:08:39,237 --> 00:08:41,330
" to get the kind of results
that you're looking for, okay?"

89
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:45,375
So, then he says to me, "Miles,
don't you think that's a little excessive?"

90
00:08:45,476 --> 00:08:50,573
And I get up, I swear to God, Ben, I get up
in front of the entire class and I say,

91
00:08:50,681 --> 00:08:53,946
" You can never have
enough capacitance probes."

92
00:08:56,587 --> 00:08:59,852
Oh, my God. What the hell
is wrong with you?

93
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,690
Huh? Oh, nothing.

94
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:06,294
I hope nothing. You just got
promoted, man. You should be happy.

95
00:09:06,397 --> 00:09:11,528
I just gotta write this essay for the
Robinson Scholarship, and I have nothing.

96
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,666
And the reason that I have nothing
is 'cause, well, I've done nothing.

97
00:09:16,774 --> 00:09:19,470
- Oh, gimme a break, Ben.
- What?

98
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:21,306
You've everything.

99
00:09:21,712 --> 00:09:26,172
You blow me out of the water,
and I'm a cerebral stud. Is that nothing?

100
00:09:26,284 --> 00:09:27,546
Yeah, well,
it doesn't dazzle.

101
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:29,916
Hey. It dazzles me, mister.

102
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:32,953
You know, ever since I was 16,
I crushed exams.

103
00:09:33,057 --> 00:09:36,424
I-I took on extracurriculars.
I showed up early.

104
00:09:36,527 --> 00:09:39,428
I even sat up at the front
and I stayed late.

105
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,498
Man, I gave up everything.

106
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:44,266
You know, I gave up fun.
I gave up sex.

107
00:09:44,368 --> 00:09:46,029
I don't think
you gave up sex.

108
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:48,367
- Okay. Maybe not sex.
- Yeah, you didn't give up sex.

109
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:50,167
All right, all right.
Not sex, but...

110
00:09:50,274 --> 00:09:52,265
It just annoys me
that the one thing

111
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:55,311
that is stopping me from
going to Harvard Med is money.

112
00:09:55,413 --> 00:09:59,645
You know, tuition fees and living expenses
alone cost over 300,000 dollars.

113
00:10:00,484 --> 00:10:02,543
300,000 dollars.

114
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:05,952
It's outrageous. It's-it's-it's
astronomically high. I get that.

115
00:10:06,057 --> 00:10:09,959
You know, I just thought
there was more to life than just money.

116
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:14,524
Well, look at the bright side,

117
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:18,195
I just saved a bunch of money
on my car insurance.

118
00:10:28,446 --> 00:10:29,606
Thank you.

119
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,475
- Happy birthday, honey.
- Thanks, mom.

120
00:10:34,585 --> 00:10:35,882
Thank you, love.
Kisses.

121
00:10:35,987 --> 00:10:37,215
Make a wish.

122
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:38,618
- Make a wish.
- Okay.

123
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:41,957
Bravo.

124
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,390
Congratulations, Benjamin.

125
00:10:43,494 --> 00:10:46,292
Did you know Miles did the frosting
on that? You see that?

126
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:49,560
It took me five minutes
to figure out it was a Fibonacci series...

127
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:52,659
Where the next number is 21.
Now you're slipping, Cam.

128
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,294
Cam, you owe
another six bucks.

129
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:56,032
No, no. I didn't eat
any of the Buffalo wings.

130
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,608
Oh, really? That's great.
Well, we're not doing it that way.

131
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:00,973
We're just dividing equally.
So, let's say you pay.

132
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:04,104
I got it, all right?
No, no. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

133
00:11:04,215 --> 00:11:07,412
It's your birthday.
You're as broke-ass as I am.

134
00:11:07,518 --> 00:11:10,453
I just wish now
I had eaten some of those wings.

135
00:11:10,554 --> 00:11:13,921
So, I nailed the specs
on the 2.09 last night,

136
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:16,391
after 19 cups of coffee.

137
00:11:16,494 --> 00:11:19,520
Check it out.
- You are kidding. You're kidding!

138
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,790
This is good.
Miles, this is-this is good.

139
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:28,133
Yeah, well, it better be 'cause this is what
we've been working for since we got here.

140
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:29,570
This is called destiny.

141
00:11:29,674 --> 00:11:31,471
You know, there is the poss...
Thank you.

142
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:35,238
There is the possibility that
we might not actually win this thing.

143
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:38,747
Oh, yeah? Bite your tongue!
Bite your damn tongue!

144
00:11:38,849 --> 00:11:41,147
Look, guys,

145
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:47,883
we don't date, we don't travel,
we don't have any money.

146
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,552
The only thing that we do have
is the 2.09 Competition.

147
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,999
If we can't even win that,
what's the point?

148
00:11:58,536 --> 00:12:00,504
Hey, hey. Look at this!

149
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:02,699
No, no, no, no.

150
00:12:06,817 --> 00:12:10,007
-Yeah.
- We... suck.

151
00:12:16,854 --> 00:12:19,618
Your father would be
so proud of you, Ben.

152
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:22,417
Yeah.

153
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:26,796
Do you remember
anything about him?

154
00:12:28,232 --> 00:12:31,565
Not really.
Maybe... when he shaved?

155
00:12:32,436 --> 00:12:34,802
Yeah, I think
I watched him shave.

156
00:12:37,074 --> 00:12:39,804
So, what are your plans
for the rest of the night?

157
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,641
I don't know. I'll probably just
go back and work on that essay.

158
00:12:43,748 --> 00:12:45,716
Ben, you're working
too hard.

159
00:12:45,816 --> 00:12:50,515
Between the job and school and the 2.09,
you've had no time for just... yourself.

160
00:12:51,088 --> 00:12:54,421
You have to squeeze in
a little time for fun, Ben.

161
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:58,552
You only turn 21 once.
And it goes by very fast.

162
00:12:58,662 --> 00:13:00,892
Okay. All right.

163
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:03,860
- Good night.
- All right, good night.

164
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:06,835
- Don't come home before 3:00.
- All right.

165
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:12,903
All right.

166
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:17,606
Now, who can explain Newton's
method and how you use it?

167
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:21,608
Uh, you can use it
to solve nonlinear equations.

168
00:13:23,487 --> 00:13:26,945
That's impressive. That's-that's really good.
I mean, I'm very impressed by that,

169
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:30,549
especially since my class
is called Nonlinear Equations.

170
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:34,887
All right, now somebody tell me
something I don't already know.

171
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:36,125
Anyone?

172
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,793
Bueller. Anyone?
Bueller.

173
00:13:39,437 --> 00:13:41,029
Newton stole it.

174
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:44,132
- I'm sorry?
- Newton stole it.

175
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:49,411
Joseph Raphson published
this same method 50 years earlier.

176
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,449
And if the start value is too far removed
from true zero, then... it fails.

177
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:58,347
- I'm sorry, what's your name?
- Ben. Ben Campbell.

178
00:13:58,456 --> 00:13:59,480
Ben.

179
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,423
So, Ben Campbell suggests
that Joseph Raphson

180
00:14:02,526 --> 00:14:04,221
was the original author
of this method.

181
00:14:04,328 --> 00:14:06,421
Well, if that's the case,
then why didn't he get any credit?

182
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,761
Well, for one thing,
Newton had a better publicist.

183
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:13,232
And for another, after 1700,
we know very little about Raphson

184
00:14:13,337 --> 00:14:17,899
other than the fact that he discovered the
Kabbalah about 300 years before Madonna.

185
00:14:18,008 --> 00:14:21,205
All right, now, let's give Ben a chance
for some extra credit, shall we?

186
00:14:21,312 --> 00:14:25,715
We're gonna call this, um,
the game show host problem, all right?

187
00:14:25,816 --> 00:14:27,841
Ben, suppose you're
on a game show.

188
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:31,444
And you are given a chance to choose
from three different doors, all right?

189
00:14:31,555 --> 00:14:36,458
Now, behind one of the doors is a new car.
Behind the other two, goats.

190
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,960
Which door
would you choose, Ben?

191
00:14:38,765 --> 00:14:40,420
Uh, door number one?

192
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:42,328
Door number one.
Ben chooses door number one.

193
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:44,424
All right, now,
the game show host,

194
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:47,504
who, by the way, knows
what's behind all the other doors,

195
00:14:47,605 --> 00:14:51,803
decides to open another door.
Let's say he chooses door number three.

196
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:55,810
Behind which sits a goat.
Now...

197
00:14:55,913 --> 00:14:57,710
Ben, game show host
comes up to you.

198
00:14:57,815 --> 00:15:00,215
He says, " Ben, do you wanna
stay with door number one

199
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,648
" or go with door
number two?"

200
00:15:01,752 --> 00:15:05,210
Now, is it in your interest
to switch your choice?

201
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,414
- Yeah.
- Well, wait.

202
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:09,618
Remember, the host knows
where the car is

203
00:15:09,727 --> 00:15:12,161
so, how do you know
he's not playing a trick on you?

204
00:15:12,263 --> 00:15:15,130
Trying to use reverse psychology
to get you to pick a goat?

205
00:15:15,232 --> 00:15:19,464
Well, I wouldn't really care.
I mean, my answer's based on statistics.

206
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,538
Based on variable change.

207
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:25,072
Variable change? But he just
asked you a simple question.

208
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,439
Yeah, which changed everything.

209
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:29,076
Enlighten us.

210
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:32,444
Well, when I was originally
asked to choose a door,

211
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:36,008
I had a 33.3% chance
of choosing right.

212
00:15:36,554 --> 00:15:40,217
But after he opens one of the doors
and then re-offers me the choice,

213
00:15:40,324 --> 00:15:44,522
it's now 66.7%
if I choose to switch.

214
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:50,328
So, yeah, I'll take door number two,
and thank you for that extra 33.3%.

215
00:15:52,937 --> 00:15:54,063
Exactly.

216
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:55,365
People, remember,

217
00:15:55,472 --> 00:15:59,704
if you don't know which door to open,
always account for variable change.

218
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,903
Now, see, most people
wouldn't take the switch

219
00:16:02,012 --> 00:16:05,504
out of paranoia,
fear, emotions.

220
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:08,517
But Mr. Campbell,
he kept emotions aside

221
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:15,449
and let simple math get
his ass into a brand-new car!

222
00:16:16,694 --> 00:16:18,821
Which is better than that goat
you've been driving around campus.

223
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:19,987
All right, everybody.

224
00:16:20,097 --> 00:16:21,496
That's the end of the day.
Thank you very much.

225
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:23,157
Your graded papers are
down here at the end.

226
00:16:23,267 --> 00:16:25,792
You can pick them
up on your way out.

227
00:16:36,213 --> 00:16:37,874
I am invincible.

228
00:16:44,822 --> 00:16:47,313
Guys, Jill Taylor,
10 o'clock.

229
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:03,937
Oh, man.
That's brutal.

230
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:09,043
You know, you should
just ask her out, man.

231
00:17:09,146 --> 00:17:11,637
It's not like she's a rocket
scientist or anything.

232
00:17:11,749 --> 00:17:13,341
Oh, wait, she is.

233
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,509
Well, why don't
you ask her?

234
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:19,281
Because... I'm, uh,
I'm already dating someone.

235
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,181
Yeah, your right hand
doesn't count, Miles.

236
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:25,591
It does the way I use it.
It does the way I use it.

237
00:17:27,331 --> 00:17:31,290
Hey, you know what? Maybe
I don't even wanna go out with her.

238
00:17:33,037 --> 00:17:34,800
Yeah, that's funny.

239
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:39,738
You know, you say
you want a life experience, right?

240
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:44,444
Well, I'd say getting down
with that would definitely qualify.

241
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,443
Cam!

242
00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:09,137
Boy genius.

243
00:18:10,074 --> 00:18:12,065
You have
to follow me now.

244
00:18:12,543 --> 00:18:15,137
- Excuse me?
- You have to follow me now.

245
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,340
Come on.

246
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,721
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

247
00:18:42,193 --> 00:18:45,602
Oh... our honored guest.

248
00:18:47,644 --> 00:18:49,407
How you doing, Ben?
- I'm okay.

249
00:18:49,513 --> 00:18:52,277
- You ever been in this room before?
- Uh, yeah.

250
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,381
Organic Chemistry
in my freshman year.

251
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:57,977
- How'd you do?
- Well, I got an A.

252
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:04,152
- Professor Rosa...
- Micky, please.

253
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:07,161
Is there... a problem
with my paper?

254
00:19:07,264 --> 00:19:10,461
Well, you found a more efficient method
for finding true zero than Isaac Newton

255
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:14,196
and that, my friend, is not so much of
a problem as it is a major ass-kicking.

256
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:19,298
Although Newton has been dead for over
250 years, so it wasn't exactly a fair fight.

257
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,770
So, is this some kind
of a math club?

258
00:19:23,947 --> 00:19:25,710
Don't be rude, people.

259
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:28,410
- Kianna.
- Fisher.

260
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:30,111
- Choi.
- Jill.

261
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:37,054
- You ever studied, uh, blackjack?
- Uh, no.

262
00:19:37,461 --> 00:19:39,588
No, really? Well,
it's really simple, actually.

263
00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:41,789
You play against the dealer.

264
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:44,057
You're given two cards.

265
00:19:44,168 --> 00:19:46,432
Face cards are worth 10 points.

266
00:19:46,537 --> 00:19:48,596
The closest to 21 wins.

267
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:52,570
If you go over, you lose.
If the dealer goes over, they lose.

268
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:56,912
It's the most popular
card game in the world.

269
00:19:57,014 --> 00:19:58,242
It's a game with memory.

270
00:19:58,348 --> 00:20:01,044
Cards drawn are the past,
ones to come are future.

271
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,881
And the best part,
it's beatable.

272
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:08,351
Are you talking
about counting cards?

273
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:13,054
No. I'm talking about
getting very, very rich.

274
00:20:15,732 --> 00:20:18,724
You-you count cards,
right? All of you?

275
00:20:18,836 --> 00:20:20,326
As a team, yes.

276
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:24,095
- When?
- Weekends. And Christian holidays.

277
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,705
- Where?
- Vegas, baby.

278
00:20:29,413 --> 00:20:31,506
So, why are you
telling me?

279
00:20:32,683 --> 00:20:35,447
Well, let's just say a spot
opened up on our roster.

280
00:20:35,552 --> 00:20:36,576
How?

281
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:39,278
Jimmy got
a job at Google.

282
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:42,825
- Jimmy got a job at Google?
- Yeah, it's catchy, I know.

283
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,756
Well, if you're making so much money
at this, then why did he take it?

284
00:20:45,863 --> 00:20:48,161
Ben, I said Google,
not Sizzler.

285
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,261
Yeah... This is crazy.

286
00:20:51,368 --> 00:20:54,064
No, Ben.
This is profitable.

287
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,604
Yeah, I-I can't do it.
So, I'm sorry.

288
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:03,646
- Come on, Ben. It'll be fun.
- Yeah, Ben, it'll be fun.

289
00:21:03,747 --> 00:21:05,305
No, it's not that.
It's...

290
00:21:05,415 --> 00:21:10,352
I just got a promotion at my job,
so, it's kind of not a good time for me.

291
00:21:10,454 --> 00:21:11,921
We pay better.

292
00:21:12,723 --> 00:21:15,351
Look, I can't-I can't just
go to Vegas on weekends.

293
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:19,088
Why not? MIT's on cruise control for you,
you've already gotten into Harvard Med.

294
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:21,357
I mean, what do you
have to worry about?

295
00:21:21,465 --> 00:21:25,526
- How did you know that?
- I like to take an interest in my students.

296
00:21:27,104 --> 00:21:31,165
Well, I'm also really involved
in the science competition.

297
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,771
You know, the 2.09 Competition?

298
00:21:34,745 --> 00:21:37,976
Wait, no. I-I'm building
a car that drives by itself.

299
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:40,914
Yeah, well, it's something I've been doing
with my friends for over a year,

300
00:21:41,018 --> 00:21:43,043
so, it's kind of important.

301
00:21:43,153 --> 00:21:46,987
Ben, let the car drive by itself.

302
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:55,187
Listen, you not only have a gifted mind,
but you're also... composed.

303
00:21:56,466 --> 00:21:59,924
You don't give in to your emotions.
You think logically.

304
00:22:01,305 --> 00:22:04,206
Ben, you were born for this.

305
00:22:04,675 --> 00:22:07,405
You'll have more fun than
you've ever had in your entire life.

306
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:08,910
It's perfect.

307
00:22:10,213 --> 00:22:14,616
Thank you. Um, but I'm...
really not the right guy.

308
00:22:15,686 --> 00:22:17,119
So, I'm sorry.

309
00:22:23,994 --> 00:22:25,120
Ben.

310
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:28,863
I hope this little conversation
we just had will remain private.

311
00:22:28,966 --> 00:22:30,661
- No, of...
- No.

312
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:32,928
You're one of
my favorite new students,

313
00:22:33,036 --> 00:22:36,267
and I'd hate to lose you,
if you know what I mean.

314
00:22:42,846 --> 00:22:45,178
- I'm just not sure it's me.
- It's boring.

315
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:48,115
It's boxy. It's blue.
How is that not you?

316
00:22:48,752 --> 00:22:50,413
So, how much is this thing
gonna run me?

317
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:55,719
Oh, well, uh, let's see, the belt's
49.95, minus 15%.

318
00:22:55,826 --> 00:22:58,488
The jacket's 589.99.

319
00:22:58,595 --> 00:23:02,156
The pants are 285.99,
minus 10% for both.

320
00:23:02,265 --> 00:23:06,531
Unfortunately, the shirt's not on sale,
but I can knock off 5% from the 69.99.

321
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,763
The shoes were just
marked down from 155,

322
00:23:08,872 --> 00:23:14,435
so you're looking at
1,042 dollars and 68 cents.

323
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:19,911
I'm pretty good
with numbers.

324
00:23:21,118 --> 00:23:23,245
- Yeah.
- I guess so.

325
00:23:23,353 --> 00:23:25,651
Yeah, so, let me know when
I can ring that up for you guys.

326
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:26,890
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thanks.

327
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:27,652
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thanks.

328
00:23:32,963 --> 00:23:33,987
Hey.

329
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:37,791
Hey.

330
00:23:39,036 --> 00:23:41,937
- Could you help me?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

331
00:23:42,739 --> 00:23:45,071
I-I'm looking for a tie.

332
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:49,578
Oh, well, we're having
a 15% sale on the ties.

333
00:23:50,814 --> 00:23:54,306
And if you want, I could
probably get you an additional 10%

334
00:23:54,418 --> 00:23:56,443
with my...
my employee discount.

335
00:23:57,587 --> 00:24:00,055
- This one's nice.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

336
00:24:01,591 --> 00:24:06,756
This one has actually been treated with
our patented Nano-Tex fabric protection,

337
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:10,924
you know, to-to repel
liquids and stains.

338
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:15,562
- Well, that's really functional.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty functional.

339
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:18,207
Face me. Stay still.

340
00:24:20,243 --> 00:24:23,610
Despite being tempted
by the Nano-Tex repellant,

341
00:24:25,282 --> 00:24:29,275
I'm actually...
not here for a tie, Ben.

342
00:24:31,855 --> 00:24:33,482
I came to see you.

343
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:35,985
You did?

344
00:24:38,261 --> 00:24:39,592
Blackjack's a great game.

345
00:24:39,696 --> 00:24:41,323
No, look,
it's easy to learn

346
00:24:41,431 --> 00:24:45,231
and there's really not as much strategy
to it as people think.

347
00:24:45,435 --> 00:24:47,426
I grew up on it, actually.

348
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:50,973
- You grew up on it?
- Yeah.

349
00:24:52,008 --> 00:24:55,307
Every night after dinner,
my father and I would play.

350
00:24:55,545 --> 00:24:59,037
I knew basic strategy
before I was, like, nine years old.

351
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,643
If I won, he'd take me out
for ice cream.

352
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:04,617
And... what if he won?

353
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:08,246
He'd still take me out
for ice cream.

354
00:25:08,358 --> 00:25:11,691
Oh, yeah. Sure, yeah,
he's your dad.

355
00:25:13,797 --> 00:25:17,062
Ben, you should feel
the thrill

356
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:21,264
of winning more money
than you can possibly imagine.

357
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:29,507
I think you should come to Vegas

358
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:34,016
'cause I'm guessing that you could
probably use a break from this place.

359
00:25:39,756 --> 00:25:40,950
I can't.

360
00:25:41,758 --> 00:25:43,157
I'm sorry.

361
00:25:44,261 --> 00:25:45,694
I just can't.

362
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:51,264
Okay. If you change your mind,
you know where we meet.

363
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,128
Yeah.

364
00:25:53,904 --> 00:25:55,769
You're welcome any time.

365
00:26:00,777 --> 00:26:03,644
You know, I think
the best thing about Vegas

366
00:26:04,347 --> 00:26:06,815
is you can become
anyone you want.

367
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:37,540
- What's the count?
- Plus 9.

368
00:26:37,647 --> 00:26:38,614
- No.
- Plus 11.

369
00:26:38,715 --> 00:26:39,704
No.

370
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:42,849
- Dude, I lost count 20 cards ago.
- Don't call me "dude."

371
00:26:42,953 --> 00:26:44,352
- Uh, plus 9?
- You're just following Jill.

372
00:26:44,454 --> 00:26:47,617
People, please. We had a total
of 76 cards that came out of the deck.

373
00:26:47,724 --> 00:26:49,851
Twenty-three were high cards
with a value of minus one.

374
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,053
Seventeen were neutral
with no value at all,

375
00:26:52,162 --> 00:26:53,891
and the rest were low cards
with a value of plus one.

376
00:26:53,997 --> 00:26:56,625
How could you lose the count?
- Plus 13.

377
00:26:59,102 --> 00:27:01,662
The count. It's plus 13.

378
00:27:05,141 --> 00:27:06,233
Yes.

379
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,002
Pull up a chair.

380
00:27:16,686 --> 00:27:17,778
Stop.

381
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:21,319
- What is it?
- Plus 12. Eggs.

382
00:27:21,424 --> 00:27:23,392
<i>Twelve eggs in a carton.</i>

383
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:25,786
- Now what?
- Plus 9.

384
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:26,953
<i>Cats have nine lives.</i>

385
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:28,030
Cat.

386
00:27:28,031 --> 00:27:29,196
Plus 16.

387
00:27:29,499 --> 00:27:30,864
<i>Sweet 16.</i>

388
00:27:31,134 --> 00:27:33,227
<i>Every card had a value.</i>

389
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:37,432
<i>A high card, minus one.
A low card, plus one.</i>

390
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,030
<i>The rest, zero.</i>

391
00:27:39,142 --> 00:27:42,407
Plus 13. Plus 8.
Plus 9. Plus 12.

392
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:46,215
<i>I was studying
all day, every day.</i>

393
00:27:46,316 --> 00:27:50,776
<i>But it wasn't physics, chemistry
and engineering. I was back to simple math,</i>

394
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:53,947
<i>used in ways I could
never have imagined.</i>

395
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:57,722
<i>The team had a system.</i>

396
00:27:58,094 --> 00:28:01,495
<i>And to go unnoticed,
we created a whole new language.</i>

397
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:05,860
<i>Words were numbers,
and numbers were words.</i>

398
00:28:06,136 --> 00:28:07,603
- Plus 17.
- Magazine.

399
00:28:07,704 --> 00:28:08,728
- Plus 6.
- Gun.

400
00:28:08,838 --> 00:28:10,635
- Plus 15.
- Paycheck.

401
00:28:10,974 --> 00:28:12,236
Plus 12.

402
00:28:12,342 --> 00:28:14,435
Uh, is this chemistry review?

403
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:20,840
- Plus 14.
- Ring.

404
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,076
- Plus 16.
- Sweet.

405
00:28:22,185 --> 00:28:23,550
Use it in a sentence.

406
00:28:23,653 --> 00:28:25,917
Man, that sugar's sweet.

407
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:31,119
<i>Because I knew the count,
I knew which cards were left in the deck.</i>

408
00:28:31,227 --> 00:28:32,751
<i>That's how
I knew what to bet.</i>

409
00:28:32,862 --> 00:28:34,557
You're doing great.

410
00:28:35,932 --> 00:28:40,631
Micky, I... I just wanna let you know
that I'm only doing this for medical school,

411
00:28:40,737 --> 00:28:42,762
which is 300,000.

412
00:28:42,872 --> 00:28:46,535
I mean, if I can get anything
close to that, then I'm done.

413
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:50,075
Well, in the first place, Ben,
it's not "if", it's " when".

414
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,842
And second of all, I get it.
I completely understand.

415
00:28:52,949 --> 00:28:55,577
- You do?
- Yeah. It's a means to an end.

416
00:28:55,685 --> 00:28:58,950
Look, they've got this new computer
software that reads people's faces,

417
00:28:59,055 --> 00:29:02,422
so, who knows how long
this gig's gonna last for any of us?

418
00:29:02,525 --> 00:29:04,254
Well, what if we get caught?

419
00:29:04,361 --> 00:29:07,421
Our system keeps us
under the radar, you'll see.

420
00:29:07,564 --> 00:29:10,192
Anyway, counting cards
isn't illegal.

421
00:29:11,101 --> 00:29:15,561
- So, there's no danger in it at all?
- No, Ben, it's safe. Very safe.

422
00:29:19,476 --> 00:29:21,842
You think you can
beat the system?

423
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:26,613
This is the system,
beating you back.

424
00:29:29,386 --> 00:29:32,514
You wanna count cards,
you do it in Atlantic City.

425
00:29:34,657 --> 00:29:36,921
Get him up.
- Come on, kid.

426
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:38,584
Count to five.

427
00:29:39,729 --> 00:29:42,391
Count to five!
- What?

428
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:46,135
Count to five, so I know you don't have
brain damage, you can go home.

429
00:29:46,236 --> 00:29:47,362
Start with one.

430
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:50,064
One, two, three, four, five.

431
00:29:50,173 --> 00:29:54,371
Good. Now, stop counting.

432
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,275
Let's go.

433
00:30:03,486 --> 00:30:05,420
You're crazy,
everybody knows to split eights.

434
00:30:05,522 --> 00:30:06,580
My grandmother splits eights.

435
00:30:06,689 --> 00:30:09,249
Not against a 10.
It's a sucker play.

436
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,986
Look, you're choosing
to play two hands

437
00:30:11,094 --> 00:30:13,211
against the highest up card
a dealer can have, right?

438
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,755
- Right, and...
- Against a five or a six, it'd be fine.

439
00:30:15,865 --> 00:30:17,924
Against a 10 or an ace,
it's a sucker play.

440
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:20,662
Yeah, Kianna, save it, all right?
Jill's right. All right?

441
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:23,068
Choi, why don't you explain
to Ben how we do?

442
00:30:23,173 --> 00:30:24,538
Oh, all right.

443
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:28,077
So, uh, our team is divided
into two kinds of players,

444
00:30:28,178 --> 00:30:29,895
spotters and big players, right?
- Yeah.

445
00:30:30,013 --> 00:30:33,772
So, if you think that this...
this table is the casino floor, then, um...

446
00:30:34,976 --> 00:30:37,410
salt 'n' pepper shakers
are your spotters. All right.

447
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,285
Spotters are just sitting
at the various blackjack tables

448
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:43,723
and they're betting the table minimum.
They never fluctuate their bet.

449
00:30:43,827 --> 00:30:46,819
That's right. Spotters never raise the bet
or play any kind of progressive system.

450
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,660
That's how we stay under the radar,
and that's why we never get caught.

451
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:52,826
Exactly. Okay, they're just sitting
at the table, betting the table min,

452
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:55,496
and they're keeping the count
waiting for one of these decks to get hot.

453
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:57,334
Right. And then when one
of the decks gets hot,

454
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,931
the spotter at that table
signals in the big player.

455
00:31:00,043 --> 00:31:02,477
This... Mustard.
Give me the mustard, honey. Please.

456
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:04,638
Well, I'm always
the mustard, so...

457
00:31:04,747 --> 00:31:08,911
When I get the signal for the hot deck,
I stumble over like some drunk rich kid,

458
00:31:09,018 --> 00:31:12,920
or some zoned out dot-com millionaire,
and I throw down big money.

459
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:15,718
So, the big player bets big
and still keeps the count.

460
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:18,020
When the deck cools,
he cashes in.

461
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:19,617
It's not as easy as it sounds.

462
00:31:19,729 --> 00:31:21,162
Oh, yeah, it's not,
you know,

463
00:31:21,264 --> 00:31:23,892
because if Grey Poupon
over here ever loses the count,

464
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,833
it's up to his table's spotter
to give him the signal to get out.

465
00:31:26,936 --> 00:31:29,530
- And you know the signals, right?
- Yeah.

466
00:31:29,772 --> 00:31:30,830
Show us.

467
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,339
Okay, what's this?

468
00:31:32,442 --> 00:31:34,842
- Uh, the deck's hot.
- Right.

469
00:31:34,944 --> 00:31:36,809
Uh, we need to talk.

470
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:39,475
The deck's cooling.

471
00:31:40,617 --> 00:31:42,744
And get out.
Get out now.

472
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,550
Good. I think he's gonna be ready
for our little trial run tomorrow.

473
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:51,522
There's a trial run?

474
00:31:52,262 --> 00:31:54,924
- Where?
- You'll find out.

475
00:32:45,949 --> 00:32:47,075
Hey.

476
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:06,564
- You Ben?
- Yeah.

477
00:33:06,936 --> 00:33:08,233
Follow me.

478
00:33:16,512 --> 00:33:17,774
This way.

479
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:27,416
Go, go. You go.

480
00:33:41,638 --> 00:33:44,402
No more bet.
No more bet.

481
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:51,437
Come on, money.

482
00:33:51,547 --> 00:33:53,344
Today, 14.

483
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:55,212
Whose side are you on?

484
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:04,753
Sixteen.

485
00:34:04,861 --> 00:34:06,954
Thank you.
Sorry, gentlemen.

486
00:34:09,565 --> 00:34:12,728
So, Henry, did I tell you I read
about this place in a magazine?

487
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:25,203
You wanna put that money down?
- Yeah. 300.

488
00:34:25,415 --> 00:34:26,575
$300.

489
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:38,019
300.

490
00:34:39,295 --> 00:34:40,762
You bet, sir?

491
00:34:42,632 --> 00:34:43,894
Thanks.

492
00:35:03,486 --> 00:35:05,716
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

493
00:35:05,888 --> 00:35:09,790
" Winner, winner,
chicken dinner." All right.

494
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:14,124
Nice.

495
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:20,565
Can I get, uh...
Can I another drink, please?

496
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,167
Thank you.

497
00:35:24,941 --> 00:35:26,772
What the hell are you doing?

498
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:30,004
What are you doing?
I haven't done anything! Get off me!

499
00:35:30,113 --> 00:35:31,740
Get off, I haven't done
anything!

500
00:35:33,816 --> 00:35:35,477
Please.
Please, let go.

501
00:35:35,585 --> 00:35:37,382
- What's the count?
- Please, don't hurt me.

502
00:35:37,487 --> 00:35:39,853
- I said, what's the count?
- Look, I haven't even done anything!

503
00:35:39,956 --> 00:35:41,514
What's the count?

504
00:35:44,026 --> 00:35:45,618
Plus 18.

505
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,458
Oh, you've gotta
be kidding.

506
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:53,728
Congratulations, Ben.

507
00:35:53,836 --> 00:35:56,066
Sorry, we had to make sure
you'd keep the count under pressure.

508
00:35:56,172 --> 00:35:57,935
Welcome to the team.

509
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:00,636
We didn't mean it.

510
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:03,678
It's okay, Campbell,
I cried inside that bag.

511
00:36:12,054 --> 00:36:15,251
Fisher and Jimmy
have always been the big players.

512
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:17,656
I want you to take
Jimmy's place.

513
00:36:18,828 --> 00:36:20,193
I've never done this.

514
00:36:20,296 --> 00:36:21,524
I know that
and I understand.

515
00:36:21,631 --> 00:36:24,759
But I don't trust the girls,
and Choi is, well, Choi.

516
00:36:24,867 --> 00:36:27,028
Look, I've been teaching
for more than 14 years,

517
00:36:27,136 --> 00:36:28,933
and I've never had
a student as impressive as you.

518
00:36:29,038 --> 00:36:31,268
Your brain is like
a goddamn Pentium chip.

519
00:36:31,374 --> 00:36:33,899
You're gonna do great.
You know how I know that?

520
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,843
'Cause you remind me
of myself 25 years ago.

521
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,240
You in?

522
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:43,850
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.
- Good. Good.

523
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,951
There's one more thing, Ben,
and this is important.

524
00:36:50,793 --> 00:36:53,557
We're counting cards,
we're not gambling.

525
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:56,890
We're following a specific set
of rules and playing a system.

526
00:36:56,999 --> 00:36:57,988
Right.

527
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,125
I've seen how crazy
it can get at those tables,

528
00:37:00,236 --> 00:37:03,137
and, sometimes,
people lose control.

529
00:37:03,573 --> 00:37:05,734
They give in
to their emotions.

530
00:37:07,009 --> 00:37:08,442
You will not.

531
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:11,203
You understand?

532
00:37:12,348 --> 00:37:13,372
Yeah.

533
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:16,284
Get some rest.

534
00:37:16,919 --> 00:37:18,944
- Some rest?
- Yeah, we're leaving tomorrow.

535
00:37:19,055 --> 00:37:22,684
Tomorrow? I-I-I have a Quantitative
Literacy paper due Tuesday.

536
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:25,218
- No, you don't.
- I don't?

537
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:27,193
No, I spoke
to Professor O'Reilly.

538
00:37:27,296 --> 00:37:29,457
I told him you were helping me
with a special assignment,

539
00:37:29,565 --> 00:37:32,193
and he understood,
so, uh, he gave you an A.

540
00:37:33,402 --> 00:37:36,894
You see, Ben, amazing things
can happen from the inside.

541
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:39,600
You'll get a call
about details later.

542
00:37:42,345 --> 00:37:43,778
So, did the girls
go on ahead, huh?

543
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,212
Oh, yeah. They got a lot
more bags to check, you know?

544
00:37:46,315 --> 00:37:47,373
Okay.

545
00:37:47,483 --> 00:37:50,384
Well, wait for us by security 'cause
Ben and I are gonna hit the head.

546
00:37:50,486 --> 00:37:51,578
No, I'm good.

547
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:54,019
No, I really think you should go.
It's a long flight.

548
00:37:54,123 --> 00:37:56,990
- No, I'm okay.
- We're going to the bathroom.

549
00:38:00,129 --> 00:38:01,858
Honestly, I-I really
don't have to go.

550
00:38:01,964 --> 00:38:03,541
- I don't care what you have to do.
- Look, I-I really don't have...

551
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:05,515
Shut up, please,
just shut up.

552
00:38:05,515 --> 00:38:07,865
What are you doin'? Why-why are you
looking over there? Look, I don't...

553
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:10,063
I don't care.
Shut up. Get in here.

554
00:38:10,172 --> 00:38:12,367
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.

555
00:38:13,576 --> 00:38:15,806
- Pull down your pants.
- What?

556
00:38:16,812 --> 00:38:18,541
Don't ask questions.

557
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,377
- Shove these in your underwear.
- Why?

558
00:38:23,486 --> 00:38:26,819
You want me to do it?
'Cause, I swear to God, I will.

559
00:38:28,591 --> 00:38:31,651
- Why can't we leave it in the bag?
- Because it shows up on the scanner.

560
00:38:31,761 --> 00:38:33,888
And we're not about
to have them confiscate 250,000.

561
00:38:33,996 --> 00:38:35,725
250,000?

562
00:38:36,165 --> 00:38:39,794
No. Why do I have to do it?
- 'Cause you're the donkey boy.

563
00:38:40,436 --> 00:38:43,098
You really suck at
not asking questions.

564
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,139
What's a donkey boy?

565
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:53,044
- Step forward, sir.
- Thanks.

566
00:38:54,483 --> 00:38:57,213
- In the basket, please.
- There's a table when you get to the line.

567
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,949
Act casual, think casual,
be casual.

568
00:39:01,057 --> 00:39:03,753
Remove your keys, any metal objects.
Laptops out, please.

569
00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:05,190
Thank you.

570
00:39:06,662 --> 00:39:10,758
If you have liquids in a Ziploc bag,
please show them to us now.

571
00:39:10,866 --> 00:39:12,925
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

572
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,219
Your boarding pass.

573
00:39:56,245 --> 00:39:57,269
Sir?

574
00:40:09,892 --> 00:40:11,621
You forgot your bag.

575
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,427
Oh. Thanks.

576
00:42:15,017 --> 00:42:16,678
Nice going, Campbell.

577
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:21,449
Hey, Ben. Basic strategy
says you should, uh, hit that.

578
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:36,665
Burt, Moishe, Vladimir,

579
00:42:36,772 --> 00:42:39,969
Mona, Miss Sommers,
your new identities are on the bar.

580
00:42:40,075 --> 00:42:42,066
So glad you could make it.

581
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:44,176
Vladimir Stupnitsky?

582
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,578
Yeah. Your dad's a diplomat
with the Russian consulate.

583
00:42:46,682 --> 00:42:47,842
You live in Washington, D.C.

584
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:51,716
Your hobbies are backgammon, chess
and long walks on the beach.

585
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,084
- I-I don't like my name.
- Why not?

586
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:57,284
" Sierra Sommers."
Do I look like a Sierra?

587
00:42:57,393 --> 00:42:59,588
Well, you have a lot of
clever outfits. You'll figure it out.

588
00:42:59,695 --> 00:43:02,858
Just pretend you don't speak English.
Then you don't have to change your hair.

589
00:43:02,965 --> 00:43:06,162
You know, I-I thought this was legal.
Why do we have to use fake names?

590
00:43:06,268 --> 00:43:08,498
Well, it is. We not only use fake names,
we use disguises.

591
00:43:08,604 --> 00:43:11,300
It's for the benefit of the dealers
to make sure you're old enough to gamble

592
00:43:11,407 --> 00:43:13,671
and it allows everyone to be
different people in different casinos.

593
00:43:13,776 --> 00:43:17,803
Hey! You steal the Bible,
you go to hell. That's the way it works.

594
00:43:18,247 --> 00:43:19,612
Like I'm not going already.

595
00:43:19,715 --> 00:43:20,807
Yeah. All right.
Now, listen.

596
00:43:20,916 --> 00:43:23,851
Ben, this is for you. All the casinos
have cameras in the ceiling.

597
00:43:23,953 --> 00:43:25,318
They're called "eyes in the sky".

598
00:43:25,421 --> 00:43:28,356
For their benefit, order a tonic water
and lime and act a little drunk,

599
00:43:28,457 --> 00:43:30,948
and, at all times,
you don't know each other.

600
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:35,360
Let me say that one more time,
you do not know each other ever.

601
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:37,691
Oh, and what's our motto?

602
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,734
- Don't get caught counting.
- Don't get caught counting.

603
00:43:39,835 --> 00:43:41,530
Thank you very much.

604
00:43:42,605 --> 00:43:44,163
How come
you don't play?

605
00:43:44,273 --> 00:43:47,470
Oh, I did. I played for a long time
and I was the best. But I'm retired now.

606
00:43:47,576 --> 00:43:50,477
Take my advice, Ben, it's always best
to go out when you're on top.

607
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:52,171
Welcome to Vegas.

608
00:44:02,424 --> 00:44:03,550
No more bets.

609
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:05,490
All right, here we go.
Big money, now. Big money.

610
00:44:05,594 --> 00:44:08,654
Let me tell you about blackjack, honey.
You ever hear of basic strategy?

611
00:44:08,764 --> 00:44:11,494
Oh, see, now that sounds
really complicated.

612
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,761
I'm Sierra Sommers from Charleston.
- Pleasure.

613
00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:16,531
Here to double
my family's inheritance.

614
00:44:18,307 --> 00:44:19,797
I don't know.

615
00:44:39,561 --> 00:44:41,028
10,000.

616
00:44:42,031 --> 00:44:43,931
Changing 10,000.

617
00:44:44,033 --> 00:44:45,898
Sweet. Too sweet.

618
00:45:06,588 --> 00:45:09,182
<i>Eight. The count's
still plus 16.</i>

619
00:45:10,793 --> 00:45:12,761
<i>Ten. That's minus one.</i>

620
00:45:13,095 --> 00:45:14,722
<i>Count's plus 15.</i>

621
00:45:16,131 --> 00:45:18,725
<i>Eight. Still plus 15.</i>

622
00:45:20,302 --> 00:45:22,270
<i>Nine. Plus 15.</i>

623
00:45:24,273 --> 00:45:26,901
<i>Five. The count's 16.</i>

624
00:45:28,544 --> 00:45:30,307
<i>Eights. Split eights.</i>

625
00:45:30,612 --> 00:45:31,636
Can I split those?

626
00:45:31,747 --> 00:45:34,739
- Sir, please don't touch the cards.
- I'm sorry.

627
00:45:41,957 --> 00:45:44,482
<i>Jack. Count's plus 15.</i>

628
00:45:47,863 --> 00:45:50,229
<i>Ten. Plus 14.</i>

629
00:45:56,438 --> 00:45:59,305
<i>King. Nine. Plus 13.</i>

630
00:46:06,315 --> 00:46:07,805
<i>Jack. Plus 12.</i>

631
00:46:08,851 --> 00:46:10,876
<i>Nine. Still plus 12.</i>

632
00:46:11,353 --> 00:46:12,718
<i>Blackjack.</i>

633
00:46:58,534 --> 00:46:59,933
Monkey! Monkey!

634
00:47:00,035 --> 00:47:01,935
- So, what's a monkey?
- Face card.

635
00:47:02,037 --> 00:47:05,438
All right, face card.
Come on, monkey. Okay, monkey.

636
00:47:08,977 --> 00:47:10,137
Monkey!

637
00:47:10,512 --> 00:47:11,911
Monkey! Come on,
give us a monkey!

638
00:47:12,014 --> 00:47:15,177
Monkey! Come on, monkey,
monkey, monkey! Monkey.

639
00:47:15,284 --> 00:47:16,774
Monkey! Monkey!

640
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:21,953
All right, all right.

641
00:47:25,494 --> 00:47:27,689
Oh, God.

642
00:47:28,831 --> 00:47:30,355
I need to quit.

643
00:47:34,588 --> 00:47:37,330
Uh, could I color up,
please?

644
00:48:20,249 --> 00:48:21,614
Nice undies.

645
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:30,181
- What's this?
- It's last night's take.

646
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:32,123
We split it fiveways.

647
00:48:37,366 --> 00:48:39,061
So, what do you think?

648
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,794
Yeah, it was fun.

649
00:48:41,236 --> 00:48:42,703
- You were good.
- Really?

650
00:48:42,804 --> 00:48:46,240
Yeah. Came in quick off the count.
You acted the part.

651
00:48:46,341 --> 00:48:50,300
You weren't afraid to play big, and
you got out when you were supposed to.

652
00:48:52,114 --> 00:48:54,605
And you made
more money than Fisher.

653
00:48:54,883 --> 00:48:57,443
Yeah, I was... I was
pretty nervous, actually.

654
00:48:58,086 --> 00:49:01,522
You know, but after a while,
it felt kind of... easy.

655
00:49:03,325 --> 00:49:04,849
Not for everyone.

656
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,087
Yeah, it's just simple math.

657
00:49:07,663 --> 00:49:10,564
Good. We can do
some serious damage with you.

658
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:18,303
Uhm... Here's the thing...
here's the thing I told Micky.

659
00:49:18,707 --> 00:49:22,905
You know, I'm only really doing this
just to pay for medical school.

660
00:49:23,011 --> 00:49:25,673
You know, 300,000 dollars
and then I'm out.

661
00:49:28,216 --> 00:49:30,343
That's what they all say.

662
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:34,748
No, really, I mean, I'm just
doing this to pay for Harvard.

663
00:49:34,856 --> 00:49:37,324
It's... just a means
to an end for me.

664
00:49:39,194 --> 00:49:40,661
I believe you.

665
00:49:41,129 --> 00:49:42,221
Good.

666
00:49:52,441 --> 00:49:55,501
<i>- Hello?
- We have a team meeting in five minutes.</i>

667
00:49:57,312 --> 00:49:58,301
Team meeting.

668
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,008
Hello?

669
00:50:00,115 --> 00:50:01,377
- Hey.
- Hey.

670
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,217
Where's everybody else?

671
00:50:03,318 --> 00:50:06,082
I don't know.
Fisher was right behind us.

672
00:50:10,058 --> 00:50:12,185
Oh, Fisher,
you didn't sleep.

673
00:50:12,561 --> 00:50:17,021
- I did. With Ida.
- Ida?

674
00:50:17,532 --> 00:50:21,161
She's a dancer.
I pulled her out of Sapphire.

675
00:50:21,703 --> 00:50:26,140
- And Ida's her dancer name?
- Yeah. After her grandmother.

676
00:50:27,175 --> 00:50:28,642
Where's Kianna?

677
00:50:28,944 --> 00:50:30,104
Slots.

678
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:35,578
- Choi, where the hell you been?
- Unattended maid cart, ninth floor.

679
00:50:36,385 --> 00:50:38,615
I've been busy this morning.

680
00:50:42,024 --> 00:50:43,423
All right, guys,
let's get something clear.

681
00:50:43,525 --> 00:50:45,755
This is not summer camp
and I'm not your counselor.

682
00:50:45,861 --> 00:50:48,261
This is real, world-class
moneymaking business.

683
00:50:48,363 --> 00:50:50,354
Kianna,
slots are for losers.

684
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:52,626
Fisher, peelers are stealers.

685
00:50:52,934 --> 00:50:53,992
Choi?
- Hmm?

686
00:50:54,302 --> 00:50:58,466
You made five grand last night,
so would you stop stealing nine-cent pens

687
00:50:58,573 --> 00:51:02,373
and everything you can get your hands on
from the maid's cart? It's embarrassing.

688
00:51:02,477 --> 00:51:06,538
But, Fisher, what the hell
were you up to last night?

689
00:51:06,915 --> 00:51:07,939
What?

690
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:11,042
Three separate occasions, the spotters
let you know that the deck was cooling,

691
00:51:11,153 --> 00:51:12,347
but you kept on anyway.

692
00:51:12,454 --> 00:51:14,046
You either lost the count
or you lost your head.

693
00:51:14,156 --> 00:51:16,090
In either case, I don't wanna
see it happen again.

694
00:51:16,191 --> 00:51:18,056
Jill, nice disguise last night.

695
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,824
And Ben, good work. You came out
of that chute like a pro. Keep it up.

696
00:51:23,899 --> 00:51:24,888
Beginner's luck.

697
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,992
Hey, Fisher. Win like a man,
lose like a man.

698
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:30,629
Micky, I didn't play
into a cold deck three times.

699
00:51:30,739 --> 00:51:32,070
You know what's worse
than a loser?

700
00:51:32,174 --> 00:51:35,405
Someone who won't admit
he played it wrong.

701
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:37,375
Take it up with Ida.

702
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:39,808
Who's Ida?

703
00:51:40,749 --> 00:51:42,307
Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.

704
00:51:42,417 --> 00:51:44,408
- Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.

705
00:52:11,346 --> 00:52:13,337
There goes that paycheck.

706
00:52:21,289 --> 00:52:24,190
- Money plays.
- Money plays, up to the limit.

707
00:52:27,429 --> 00:52:29,363
How's she...
how's she doing?

708
00:52:29,765 --> 00:52:31,062
Oh, that doesn't matter, man.

709
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:34,067
The way I see it, yesterday's
history, tomorrow's a mystery.

710
00:52:34,169 --> 00:52:36,967
It's all what you do
in the moment, baby.

711
00:52:49,117 --> 00:52:51,176
Just lost another property.

712
00:52:52,254 --> 00:52:55,655
- Who is it this time, Caesar's or the Mirage?
- Caesar's.

713
00:52:57,259 --> 00:52:59,318
That was a 14-year account.

714
00:52:59,661 --> 00:53:03,597
- They opted to go with the new software.
- I know, Terry, I know.

715
00:53:04,232 --> 00:53:09,192
Hey, Cole. We got absolutely murdered in
pits four and five the last couple of nights.

716
00:53:09,304 --> 00:53:12,102
Okay, Clark, I'll, uh,
take a look at the tape.

717
00:53:12,307 --> 00:53:15,743
By the way, you, uh,
wanna lose the cigarette?

718
00:53:17,212 --> 00:53:20,204
There's no smoking in here,
you know that.

719
00:53:26,354 --> 00:53:27,878
I appreciate it.

720
00:53:34,563 --> 00:53:36,531
End of an era,
my friend.

721
00:53:45,774 --> 00:53:47,605
Ben. Time for school.

722
00:53:51,446 --> 00:53:53,607
I seem to keep
waking up to you.

723
00:53:53,715 --> 00:53:55,376
Don't get used to it.

724
00:54:14,369 --> 00:54:16,860
I'm glad you came over
this morning.

725
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:20,975
I have something I wanna give you.
- Oh, yeah?

726
00:54:23,445 --> 00:54:25,470
I want you to have this.

727
00:54:26,181 --> 00:54:27,443
What's this?

728
00:54:33,054 --> 00:54:34,885
That's a lot of money.

729
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:39,019
I've been saving for a long time.
It's for medical school.

730
00:54:39,127 --> 00:54:43,461
I know it won't pay
the whole way, but it should help.

731
00:54:44,766 --> 00:54:47,633
Ma, I can't take this.

732
00:54:48,136 --> 00:54:50,263
This is your money.
You worked hard for this.

733
00:54:50,372 --> 00:54:55,173
For precisely this reason. I wanna help
pay for med school, dr. Campbell.

734
00:55:01,349 --> 00:55:03,214
Well, you know what?
You don't have to.

735
00:55:03,318 --> 00:55:06,754
'Cause, uh, I got
the Robinson scholarship.

736
00:55:07,522 --> 00:55:10,047
Yep, they're gonna pay
the whole way.

737
00:55:10,592 --> 00:55:14,392
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Well, because... I wanted it to be a surprise.

738
00:55:14,496 --> 00:55:16,691
And, actually,
I just found out today.

739
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:20,189
- I can't believe it! Oh, my God!
- I know.

740
00:55:20,189 --> 00:55:23,533
This is amazing.
I am so proud of you.

741
00:55:28,343 --> 00:55:31,540
I knew the hard work would pay off.
- Yeah, I know.

742
00:55:31,646 --> 00:55:36,140
So, listen, you... you keep this,
all right? That's... yours.

743
00:56:15,223 --> 00:56:16,884
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

744
00:56:17,993 --> 00:56:21,861
I'm... just... jumping up
and down on my bed.

745
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,964
What? You never did that
when you were a kid?

746
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:30,560
- No. Not really, never.
- No.

747
00:56:31,573 --> 00:56:32,699
Right.

748
00:56:35,977 --> 00:56:37,137
All right.

749
00:56:37,245 --> 00:56:39,679
So, where were you this weekend?
I tried calling you, like, 15 times.

750
00:56:39,781 --> 00:56:43,444
Oh, yeah? I-I-I ended up
having to go to, uh, New Hampshire

751
00:56:43,551 --> 00:56:45,951
to help my cousin move.

752
00:56:46,054 --> 00:56:47,988
You didn't bring
your cell phone?

753
00:56:48,089 --> 00:56:50,819
Your cell? Your phone?
You didn't bring that?

754
00:56:50,925 --> 00:56:56,227
No, I, uh, I-I forgot it. I, uh, ended up
leaving it here. So, you know...

755
00:56:56,331 --> 00:56:58,697
Yeah, well, you missed
a hell of a dorm party on Saturday.

756
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,333
Oh, yeah?

757
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:02,365
We, uh, we almost
had a girl there.

758
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,902
- Republik?
- Yes.

759
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:09,434
Let's do it!

760
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:20,344
She is an eight.

761
00:57:20,688 --> 00:57:25,125
- No way. She's a 7.649.
- I was rounding up.

762
00:57:25,226 --> 00:57:28,195
Hey, I thought we agreed
we weren't gonna round up anymore.

763
00:57:28,296 --> 00:57:29,820
That's right.

764
00:57:30,698 --> 00:57:34,634
But, if we win the 2.09,
I'm asking her out.

765
00:57:42,877 --> 00:57:45,710
Wait. Ben? Ben, you only
owe eight bucks.

766
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,120
Hey. I... C-can I
get you a beer?

767
00:57:57,025 --> 00:57:59,823
- Sure.
- Yeah? Okay.

768
00:58:03,216 --> 00:58:06,590
Uh, excuse me.
Can I get two Bud Lights?

769
00:58:07,035 --> 00:58:08,127
Hey.

770
00:58:12,974 --> 00:58:14,839
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

771
00:58:14,943 --> 00:58:16,433
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

772
00:58:17,312 --> 00:58:18,609
Thank you.

773
00:58:24,786 --> 00:58:27,152
Are those your friends
over there?

774
00:58:30,725 --> 00:58:34,889
No. No, I've never seen them
before in my life.

775
00:58:36,364 --> 00:58:39,060
Could you just excuse me
for... one second?

776
00:58:41,369 --> 00:58:44,429
Guys, I'm serious.
What are you doing? You're staring.

777
00:58:44,539 --> 00:58:45,597
Yeah, we know.

778
00:58:45,707 --> 00:58:46,731
Yeah, well, can you not?

779
00:58:46,841 --> 00:58:48,604
I think it's gonna freak
her out a bit, don't you think?

780
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:52,339
Yeah, I, uh, I got a feeling we're a little
more freaked out than she is right now.

781
00:58:52,447 --> 00:58:54,108
So, how do you know her?

782
00:58:54,215 --> 00:58:57,707
Did you, like, take some self-help
seminar or something?

783
00:58:58,786 --> 00:58:59,844
What?

784
00:59:00,355 --> 00:59:03,916
- Jedi mind trick, huh?
- Jedi mind trick. Like that Luke.

785
00:59:04,192 --> 00:59:07,184
- You will drink beer.
- Right. Right, right.

786
00:59:07,295 --> 00:59:10,389
There is a fortune on the table now,
and it's all up to my dad.

787
00:59:10,498 --> 00:59:12,090
It's getting ridiculous.

788
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,761
He actually needs to stop the table play,
track down my uncle and take a loan.

789
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:17,337
- No, are you serious?
- Yeah.

790
00:59:17,438 --> 00:59:19,429
They let him,
and he does.

791
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:23,075
He ends up with, like,
two 19s and two 20s.

792
00:59:23,745 --> 00:59:26,236
The dealer turns over a 17.

793
00:59:26,347 --> 00:59:28,076
It's soft. He needs
to take another card.

794
00:59:28,183 --> 00:59:30,549
No. Don't say a four.
Is it a four?

795
00:59:30,652 --> 00:59:33,450
- It's a four, yeah.
- It's a four. Ah, my God.

796
00:59:34,789 --> 00:59:37,087
Not a great Christmas
that year.

797
00:59:39,627 --> 00:59:43,085
So, what does he think about
what you do? D-d-does he know?

798
00:59:43,665 --> 00:59:45,826
Oh, no, he's long gone, Ben.

799
00:59:48,403 --> 00:59:50,200
My dad's gone, too.

800
01:00:03,056 --> 01:00:07,451
So, uh, you know, when you came
into the store to ask me to join the team,

801
01:00:08,289 --> 01:00:09,950
was that because...

802
01:00:10,358 --> 01:00:11,552
What?

803
01:00:11,893 --> 01:00:15,226
Well, you know, was it
because... Micky asked you to?

804
01:00:18,366 --> 01:00:21,494
Look, we've had
three classes together.

805
01:00:22,503 --> 01:00:25,472
You gave that presentation
on combinatorial algorithms

806
01:00:25,573 --> 01:00:27,404
that nobody understood.

807
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:32,741
You're the smartest person in every
single one of those classes, Ben.

808
01:00:32,847 --> 01:00:37,011
That is why you're on the team.
And that's why I came into the store.

809
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:40,153
Oh, wait, no, no,
not so much...

810
01:00:40,255 --> 01:00:43,122
- Oh, God. I'm so, so sorry.
- No. It's fine.

811
01:00:43,224 --> 01:00:45,658
It's not a problem.
- I-I don't know why I just did that.

812
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,988
- Don't apologize.
- Are-are you sure?

813
01:00:47,095 --> 01:00:49,655
Yes. Um, shit,
this is-this my stop.

814
01:00:49,764 --> 01:00:52,164
- You're getting off here?
- Yeah, I've gotta get off.

815
01:00:52,267 --> 01:00:54,963
But, really,
don't worry about it.

816
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:58,833
I... It's... I don't know, it's just
'cause we've been drinking, and...

817
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:01,431
It's just we're on a team,
we work together.

818
01:01:01,542 --> 01:01:03,976
- I-I get it.
- Just don't feel bad about this.

819
01:01:04,078 --> 01:01:04,677
- Okay.
- Okay.

820
01:01:04,677 --> 01:01:06,473
Sure. Bye.

821
01:01:26,734 --> 01:01:30,465
<i>My world was flashing by
at a million miles a minute.</i>

822
01:01:31,806 --> 01:01:34,775
<i>I had saved
over 100,000 dollars.</i>

823
01:01:35,943 --> 01:01:38,002
<i>Only 200,000 to go.</i>

824
01:01:39,213 --> 01:01:43,149
<i>But there was still one thing
I couldn't get off my mind.</i>

825
01:01:53,561 --> 01:01:55,256
<i>The moment we left campus,</i>

826
01:01:55,363 --> 01:01:57,627
<i>the concept of
vectors and formulas</i>

827
01:01:57,732 --> 01:02:00,428
<i>were replaced with
counting, shuffle tracking</i>

828
01:02:00,535 --> 01:02:03,698
<i>knowing when to hit and
knowing when to color out.</i>

829
01:02:03,938 --> 01:02:06,532
<i>I was becoming
a pro on all levels.</i>

830
01:02:07,008 --> 01:02:08,805
<i>I made more money
in one trip to Vegas</i>

831
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:14,314
<i>than I would have in 5 years, 9 months,
12 days and 6 hours at J. Press Menswear.</i>

832
01:02:16,684 --> 01:02:19,152
<i>In Boston, I was
just Ben Campbell.</i>

833
01:02:20,188 --> 01:02:23,919
<i>But in Vegas, I could be
anyone I wanted.</i>

834
01:02:24,025 --> 01:02:26,323
You know what I'm gonna do?
You know what I'm gonna do?

835
01:02:26,427 --> 01:02:29,692
I'm gonna throw a half-mill down
on the one hand. Come on. Hit me!

836
01:02:29,797 --> 01:02:33,028
<i>One night, I'd be the high-rolling heir
to a pharmaceutical fortune.</i>

837
01:02:33,134 --> 01:02:36,262
Leon, could you make sure
there's some champagne,

838
01:02:36,671 --> 01:02:40,334
maybe some strawberries
waiting in there for me.

839
01:02:40,842 --> 01:02:42,173
I may not be alone.

840
01:02:42,276 --> 01:02:45,905
<i>The next, I'd be the hottest video game
designer on the West Coast.</i>

841
01:02:46,514 --> 01:02:47,913
There it is.

842
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:51,507
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner!

843
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:57,751
No, please, keep going.
This video's priceless.

844
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:00,887
<i>I'm not gonna lie.</i>

845
01:03:01,596 --> 01:03:06,090
<i>It did get, well...
a little confusing sometimes.</i>

846
01:03:07,034 --> 01:03:08,626
<i>Operator, how can I help you?</i>

847
01:03:08,736 --> 01:03:11,034
Ah, yeah, um, room service.

848
01:03:11,139 --> 01:03:13,573
<i>Excuse me? Honey,
we don't do room service.</i>

849
01:03:13,674 --> 01:03:15,335
What do you mean,
you don't do room service?

850
01:03:15,443 --> 01:03:17,809
<i>I mean, we don't
do room service.</i>

851
01:03:29,857 --> 01:03:32,519
<i>In Boston, we had a secret.</i>

852
01:03:38,299 --> 01:03:41,393
<i>In Vegas, we had a life.</i>

853
01:03:49,877 --> 01:03:54,314
<i>Micky said I was gonna have more fun
than I could possibly imagine.</i>

854
01:03:55,483 --> 01:03:57,041
<i>And he was right.</i>

855
01:04:01,022 --> 01:04:03,081
- Hey, Jamie. There you go.
- Nice.

856
01:04:03,191 --> 01:04:04,886
<i>It was too good to be true.</i>

857
01:04:04,992 --> 01:04:09,019
Ah, there you go. All right, my night
just got better. Thank you, Joe.

858
01:04:10,097 --> 01:04:12,964
<i>And it felt like it was
never going to end.</i>

859
01:04:23,344 --> 01:04:26,438
Clark? I got something
over here.

860
01:04:27,148 --> 01:04:28,843
Take a look at this.

861
01:04:31,352 --> 01:04:33,820
That guy? He's a kid.

862
01:04:33,921 --> 01:04:37,652
He was on the tape from last week.
Got a big roll and he's crushing your table.

863
01:04:37,758 --> 01:04:40,124
Plus, he ordered
a tonic and lime.

864
01:04:40,228 --> 01:04:42,924
Tonic and lime.
What does that mean?

865
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:45,260
It means he wants you
to think he's drinking.

866
01:04:45,366 --> 01:04:48,665
Okay. So, is he counting
or is he just getting lucky?

867
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:50,804
He's not running
a progressive system.

868
01:04:50,905 --> 01:04:54,102
He doubled on 10 when the deck was heavy,
but he didn't on 11 when it got lighter.

869
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:56,836
- How can you tell if it's heavy or light?
- I'm counting.

870
01:04:56,944 --> 01:04:58,104
You...

871
01:05:01,449 --> 01:05:03,246
Tell me something, Cole,
if you can count that well,

872
01:05:03,351 --> 01:05:05,080
why are you still
consulting for us?

873
01:05:05,186 --> 01:05:06,653
I've been asking myself
the same thing.

874
01:05:06,754 --> 01:05:10,190
Let's just say I like being
on your side of the hustle.

875
01:05:10,625 --> 01:05:13,617
Bring up a frame of that
for me on the printer.

876
01:05:17,131 --> 01:05:19,622
So, Terry, I heard you guys
are losing a lot of work

877
01:05:19,734 --> 01:05:22,760
to that biometric
facial recognition software.

878
01:05:24,338 --> 01:05:27,933
Just gives us a little bit
more time to focus on you guys.

879
01:05:30,478 --> 01:05:33,208
- That's impressive software.
- They do.

880
01:05:33,881 --> 01:05:35,212
Here he is.

881
01:05:37,552 --> 01:05:40,612
I still think there're
bigger fish to fry out there.

882
01:05:40,721 --> 01:05:42,052
So do I.

883
01:05:49,931 --> 01:05:51,523
Hey, Fisher.

884
01:05:51,632 --> 01:05:53,691
Ah, he's mad at me
and jealous of you.

885
01:05:53,801 --> 01:05:56,292
But don't worry. Greatness evokes
that reaction sometimes.

886
01:05:56,404 --> 01:05:59,339
Don't worry about it. I gotta go.
- All right.

887
01:06:08,215 --> 01:06:10,183
- Hey.
- What's going on?

888
01:06:11,419 --> 01:06:15,048
Ah, he... just didn't like the subject
I chose for my final paper.

889
01:06:15,156 --> 01:06:16,783
- That's bullshit, Ben.
- What?

890
01:06:16,891 --> 01:06:18,825
I know when you're lying,
I'm your best friend.

891
01:06:18,926 --> 01:06:20,951
At least, I thought I was.

892
01:06:22,096 --> 01:06:23,688
Are you on drugs, Ben?

893
01:06:23,798 --> 01:06:25,732
Because there's a group that meets
at Simpson Hall on Saturdays.

894
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:27,767
No, no. Cam, I'm not
on drugs, okay?

895
01:06:27,868 --> 01:06:30,632
I'll go to the meeting
if you need me to.

896
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:33,968
Why didn't you tell me
you quit J. Press?

897
01:06:35,443 --> 01:06:36,876
I don't know.

898
01:06:37,345 --> 01:06:39,575
- Is it Jill Taylor?
- No.

899
01:06:41,749 --> 01:06:43,410
What about Harvard?

900
01:06:44,885 --> 01:06:47,547
It'll find a way of
working itself out.

901
01:06:48,255 --> 01:06:50,849
Look, I gotta go.
I'll see you.

902
01:07:03,137 --> 01:07:07,233
<i>I think the worst part of it
was... not being able to tell anyone.</i>

903
01:07:11,412 --> 01:07:15,542
<i>But for the first time in my life,
the world made itself easy for me.</i>

904
01:07:17,184 --> 01:07:18,310
Here you go, sir.

905
01:07:18,419 --> 01:07:19,977
<i>And I liked it.</i>

906
01:07:20,688 --> 01:07:22,155
That's for you.

907
01:07:24,425 --> 01:07:28,759
We just made two hundred
and ten... thousand dollars.

908
01:07:28,863 --> 01:07:29,921
Yes.

909
01:07:30,031 --> 01:07:32,522
Now, Ben,
this is how we play!

910
01:07:35,169 --> 01:07:37,603
<i>And play we did.</i>

911
01:07:41,842 --> 01:07:43,935
<i>Nothing cost too much.</i>

912
01:07:44,045 --> 01:07:46,570
<i>Nothing was out of reach.</i>

913
01:07:52,219 --> 01:07:55,052
<i>I guess you could say
the casino host of fate</i>

914
01:07:55,156 --> 01:07:57,750
<i>gave Ben Campbell
a major upgrade.</i>

915
01:08:00,728 --> 01:08:03,595
<i>Dorm rooms turned into
high-roller suites.</i>

916
01:08:05,266 --> 01:08:07,791
<i>Bicycles became
stretch limos.</i>

917
01:08:11,439 --> 01:08:12,872
No, no!

918
01:08:16,177 --> 01:08:20,637
<i>And college bars that were always filled
with frat dudes were upgraded to,</i>

919
01:08:21,482 --> 01:08:25,384
<i>well, something
more... interesting.</i>

920
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:23,006
- Hey, baby. Where you in from?
- Uh, I-I'm from Boston.

921
01:09:24,278 --> 01:09:28,180
- On a convention?
- No, uh, business, actually.

922
01:09:30,384 --> 01:09:32,750
What line of work
you in, mister?

923
01:09:33,487 --> 01:09:35,250
I-I count things.

924
01:09:37,424 --> 01:09:39,016
My name's Sierra.

925
01:09:39,593 --> 01:09:44,826
Hi, Sierra. I'm, uh,
Salvador Sanchez.

926
01:09:46,834 --> 01:09:49,598
Would you like
a private dance, Salvador?

927
01:09:51,205 --> 01:09:55,107
Well, that all depends on
how much it's gonna run me, Sierra.

928
01:09:57,611 --> 01:10:00,239
20 a song, 30-song minimum.

929
01:10:02,116 --> 01:10:03,708
Sounds expensive.

930
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:27,230
- Good evening, Mr. Klein.
- Hey, Frank. It's good to see you.

931
01:10:27,341 --> 01:10:29,832
Jeffrey, you're taking my money.

932
01:10:30,945 --> 01:10:32,913
You are so lucky
you're cute.

933
01:10:33,013 --> 01:10:35,709
'Cause if you weren't cute,
I'd leave. You know that?

934
01:10:35,816 --> 01:10:39,377
Jeffrey. My brother
from another mother.

935
01:10:39,954 --> 01:10:41,046
How you doing? You good?

936
01:10:41,155 --> 01:10:44,352
I'm good, I'm good, Mr. K. What,
are you back in town for business?

937
01:10:44,458 --> 01:10:49,589
- It's all business in this town, right?
- Well, with your money, I'm sure it always is.

938
01:10:50,497 --> 01:10:52,431
Oh, damn,
I forgot my ring.

939
01:10:52,533 --> 01:10:54,433
Oh, please.

940
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:04,473
Oh, I don't wanna bet that.
That's for... that's for keep.

941
01:11:04,812 --> 01:11:06,507
100,000 going out.

942
01:11:08,883 --> 01:11:10,544
Thank you, Jeffrey.

943
01:11:17,758 --> 01:11:18,773
- Cole.
- Yeah.

944
01:11:18,773 --> 01:11:19,807
 Your boy's back.

945
01:11:23,831 --> 01:11:25,389
That's him, right?
- There he is.

946
01:11:25,499 --> 01:11:28,525
And he brought a whole lot
more money with him.

947
01:11:35,676 --> 01:11:38,236
That is a hell of a suit,
by the way.

948
01:11:53,827 --> 01:11:58,059
That is some aftershave he has going on.
- Sir, could you not? Please.

949
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:06,437
This girl's only betting the table minimum.
Why's she keep looking at him?

950
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:11,239
Terry, rewind the tape. I wanna see
if she, uh, signals him to come to the table.

951
01:12:12,646 --> 01:12:16,241
We don't use "tape" anymore,
old school. It's digital now.

952
01:12:18,652 --> 01:12:20,813
Never mind.
Terry, rewind it.

953
01:12:23,691 --> 01:12:25,215
Okay, okay.

954
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,621
She's playing
the table minimum.

955
01:12:27,728 --> 01:12:29,889
Now, in a second,
she's gonna do something.

956
01:12:29,997 --> 01:12:33,865
She's gonna, uh, raise her hand,
scratch her head... There it is.

957
01:12:35,035 --> 01:12:37,970
That's the signal. See?
She gave him the signal.

958
01:12:38,072 --> 01:12:41,405
He comes to the table. I'm telling you,
they're working together.

959
01:12:41,508 --> 01:12:42,566
Nice.

960
01:12:44,244 --> 01:12:46,804
Show me a computer
that can do that.

961
01:12:51,652 --> 01:12:53,279
You look familiar.

962
01:12:54,588 --> 01:12:56,351
I know you, don't I?

963
01:12:57,958 --> 01:12:59,789
- I don't think so.
- No?

964
01:13:00,327 --> 01:13:04,593
Oh, sure, you look exactly like
that guy in Rain Man.

965
01:13:06,934 --> 01:13:09,767
Oh, yeah? Well, people say
I look like Tom Cruise all the time.

966
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:11,565
Oh, yeah? No, I'd, uh...

967
01:13:12,673 --> 01:13:16,336
The other one, the... What's his...
Uhhh... The retard.

968
01:13:17,344 --> 01:13:22,577
I just love that scene in Vegas
when the retard wins at blackjack.

969
01:13:23,517 --> 01:13:25,451
You look just like that.

970
01:13:29,323 --> 01:13:36,195
What I could never understand, though,
is how someone so retarded,

971
01:13:37,097 --> 01:13:38,792
could win so much.

972
01:13:41,168 --> 01:13:44,660
Hey, Jeffrey, his brother
from another mother,

973
01:13:44,772 --> 01:13:46,535
how did that retard
win so much?

974
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,575
- You know what, sir? I think that maybe...
- Okay, get your hands off me.

975
01:13:49,676 --> 01:13:51,871
Oh, I didn't mean it.

976
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,277
His luck'll run out eventually.
It always does.

977
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:41,890
- Hey, Ben...
- No, Ben, stop it!

978
01:14:41,995 --> 01:14:43,860
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- Hey, come on! Ben!

979
01:14:43,964 --> 01:14:47,422
Oh, you think that's funny?
You think that was funny? Shut up!

980
01:14:47,534 --> 01:14:48,899
I understand, Ben.
We don't need any more...

981
01:14:49,002 --> 01:14:50,833
This is not the time. Okay?

982
01:14:50,938 --> 01:14:53,240
I wanna thank you for
confirming my choice in Ben.

983
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,776
- Sure.
- Now, go home.

984
01:15:01,582 --> 01:15:03,573
- What?
- You're off the team.

985
01:15:03,684 --> 01:15:04,742
No.

986
01:15:05,752 --> 01:15:09,119
- I was-I was drunk, I was...
- I don't care what you were.

987
01:15:10,357 --> 01:15:11,654
I'm not leaving.

988
01:15:11,758 --> 01:15:14,283
Yes, you are.

989
01:15:14,795 --> 01:15:17,263
What are you gonna do
about it, huh?

990
01:15:21,135 --> 01:15:25,003
You've been the big man for a long time,
but you just acted like a child.

991
01:15:25,105 --> 01:15:28,233
So, I want you to pick up
the ticket and go home,

992
01:15:28,342 --> 01:15:32,369
because if you don't, you know exactly
what I'm capable of doing,

993
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:34,277
don't you?

994
01:15:51,532 --> 01:15:52,521
All right, listen up.

995
01:15:52,633 --> 01:15:56,160
Casino's gonna change out their chips,
just like the MGM did after the Tyson fight.

996
01:15:56,270 --> 01:15:59,137
That means we got less
than 24 hours to cash in,

997
01:15:59,239 --> 01:16:01,503
or we're gonna be sitting with
200 grand of worthless plastic.

998
01:16:01,608 --> 01:16:03,838
- So, we'll cash out.
- It's too hot.

999
01:16:03,944 --> 01:16:07,846
They're gonna be dissecting the eye in
the sky footage of Fisher's little power play.

1000
01:16:07,948 --> 01:16:10,143
So, let's do it right now
before they can do that.

1001
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:12,218
Are you deliberately slow?

1002
01:16:13,053 --> 01:16:14,611
What about them?

1003
01:16:15,989 --> 01:16:17,547
What about them?

1004
01:16:17,658 --> 01:16:21,958
They can cash in the chips.
The casino's just gonna think they're tips.

1005
01:16:29,403 --> 01:16:30,836
- Cashing out.
- Thank you.

1006
01:16:30,938 --> 01:16:33,031
- Thank you.
- Thanks, sweetie.

1007
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:36,074
- Thanks, hon.
- Thank you, baby.

1008
01:16:40,747 --> 01:16:42,806
I love a parade,
don't you?

1009
01:16:43,984 --> 01:16:47,750
You know, there's a word
I don't throw around all that often,

1010
01:16:48,355 --> 01:16:49,583
"Genius".

1011
01:17:18,085 --> 01:17:21,111
Hey, Kianna. Let me hold
your bag for a second.

1012
01:17:21,822 --> 01:17:23,084
Thanks, baby, here.

1013
01:17:23,190 --> 01:17:24,680
Oh, no problem. Anytime.

1014
01:17:24,791 --> 01:17:27,692
- Watch. Watch, watch. Ready?
- Okay, I'm watching. That's beautiful.

1015
01:17:27,794 --> 01:17:28,783
Watch.

1016
01:17:28,895 --> 01:17:32,626
No, it's great, you just need a little, uh,
to get your knee a little higher.

1017
01:17:54,788 --> 01:17:56,312
- Hi.
- Hey.

1018
01:17:57,691 --> 01:18:00,125
So, the Hard Rock
comped me a suite.

1019
01:18:01,361 --> 01:18:03,329
That's cool, that's great.

1020
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,095
You wanna see it?

1021
01:19:10,464 --> 01:19:13,126
All right, take care, Bobby.
All right?

1022
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:35,144
God, it's cold.

1023
01:19:35,589 --> 01:19:37,489
Hey, what time is it?

1024
01:19:38,458 --> 01:19:41,621
He's only 45 minutes late.
Show a little patience.

1025
01:19:43,029 --> 01:19:45,088
Oh, look.
Here he comes.

1026
01:19:45,899 --> 01:19:47,890
Guys, I'm sorry I'm late.

1027
01:19:48,001 --> 01:19:49,229
Hey, Ben.

1028
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:51,300
You know, you could try
returning a call once in a while.

1029
01:19:51,405 --> 01:19:53,566
Good of you to show up, man.
It's not like we're cold or anything.

1030
01:19:53,673 --> 01:19:55,038
Yeah, funny.

1031
01:19:56,343 --> 01:19:59,972
- Hey, did you bring it?
- Yeah, I got it. There it is.

1032
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:03,015
And you're sure you didn't inlay
the software on more space

1033
01:20:03,116 --> 01:20:04,310
than the parameters suggest?

1034
01:20:04,418 --> 01:20:06,443
No. It's just one-fifth
of the free face.

1035
01:20:06,553 --> 01:20:08,544
Let's fire this mother up.

1036
01:20:08,655 --> 01:20:09,917
Beautiful.

1037
01:20:18,765 --> 01:20:19,993
Okay.

1038
01:20:20,534 --> 01:20:21,626
Okay.

1039
01:20:25,138 --> 01:20:26,730
What's happening?

1040
01:20:30,076 --> 01:20:32,601
- I don't understand.
- It's the wrong size.

1041
01:20:32,712 --> 01:20:33,974
No. What?

1042
01:20:35,048 --> 01:20:38,347
- What the hell, Ben? This is an 8K.
- Right.

1043
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:41,920
Yeah, we needed 16K!

1044
01:20:43,356 --> 01:20:47,156
I can't believe this.
- I-I thought it was an-an 8K.

1045
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:48,852
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

1046
01:20:48,962 --> 01:20:53,194
No, you didn't. You knew the entire
time the discrete was 16K.

1047
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:54,962
Damn it, Ben.

1048
01:20:55,068 --> 01:20:58,333
It's gonna take us two weeks
to get a fresh 16K from the fabrication.

1049
01:20:58,438 --> 01:21:01,839
And another five days, minimum,
to get it ready to press.

1050
01:21:01,942 --> 01:21:05,378
Miles, calm down, all right?
It was, uh, an honest mistake.

1051
01:21:08,014 --> 01:21:09,311
What?

1052
01:21:11,651 --> 01:21:16,418
You know what? Um, I think we're gonna
have to go at this without you, man.

1053
01:21:17,524 --> 01:21:19,219
You-you're gonna what?

1054
01:21:22,062 --> 01:21:25,657
No, no. This is just
as much mine as it is yours.

1055
01:21:25,765 --> 01:21:28,359
We've been working on this
for over a year.

1056
01:21:28,468 --> 01:21:32,029
I know that. But your heart
just isn't in this anymore.

1057
01:21:37,811 --> 01:21:39,369
You serious?

1058
01:21:46,086 --> 01:21:47,110
Fine.

1059
01:21:48,955 --> 01:21:50,047
Fine.

1060
01:21:51,458 --> 01:21:55,690
You know what? I don't even care.
Honestly, I don't even care.

1061
01:21:55,795 --> 01:21:57,023
You know why?

1062
01:21:57,130 --> 01:22:01,499
'Cause no one in the real world gives
a shit about the 2.09 Competition.

1063
01:22:02,602 --> 01:22:04,467
You know, it's just something
that you build up in your head

1064
01:22:04,571 --> 01:22:06,562
to make yourselves
feel important.

1065
01:22:06,673 --> 01:22:08,573
You guys are pathetic.

1066
01:22:08,675 --> 01:22:09,835
Thanks.

1067
01:22:16,816 --> 01:22:18,215
Welcome back, Mr. Youngman.

1068
01:22:18,318 --> 01:22:22,084
- Thanks, Joseph. It's good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

1069
01:22:25,725 --> 01:22:28,717
Good evening, Mr. Youngman,
welcome back to the Red Rock.

1070
01:22:28,828 --> 01:22:30,295
Nice to see you.

1071
01:22:30,397 --> 01:22:33,059
Anything I can do for you,
let me know.

1072
01:22:50,617 --> 01:22:51,982
Double down.

1073
01:23:27,721 --> 01:23:30,747
I guess you play big
or you don't play at all.

1074
01:23:31,958 --> 01:23:33,186
Right?

1075
01:23:35,695 --> 01:23:39,722
Honey, there you are. Let's go.
We don't wanna miss the show!

1076
01:23:39,833 --> 01:23:42,631
Honey, we're actually
playing a game here.

1077
01:23:43,103 --> 01:23:44,195
Yeah.

1078
01:23:44,604 --> 01:23:46,367
Yeah, so,
you know what?

1079
01:23:46,473 --> 01:23:50,534
Why don't you run upstairs
and, uh, wait for me there? Okay?

1080
01:23:53,146 --> 01:23:54,977
All right. Let's go.

1081
01:24:00,153 --> 01:24:02,144
Yeah, all right.

1082
01:24:02,756 --> 01:24:05,350
I've got the worst
headache right now.

1083
01:24:19,372 --> 01:24:21,203
- Ten.
- Come on, monkey.

1084
01:24:21,307 --> 01:24:23,673
- Fourteen.
- Come on. Come on, monkey.

1085
01:24:23,777 --> 01:24:25,904
- Sixteen.
- Monkey. Come on.

1086
01:24:27,213 --> 01:24:28,646
Twenty-one.

1087
01:24:35,088 --> 01:24:37,022
Pete, you're killing us.

1088
01:24:50,270 --> 01:24:52,261
I guess it's not my night.

1089
01:25:17,067 --> 01:25:19,277
Are you out of your mind?

1090
01:25:19,943 --> 01:25:22,725
I, uh, I don't know
what happened.

1091
01:25:23,002 --> 01:25:25,630
I-I messed up.
I'm sorry.

1092
01:25:26,011 --> 01:25:28,034
Oh, oh, you're sorry.

1093
01:25:28,141 --> 01:25:31,736
Oh, see, now that's what I've been waiting
to hear, Ben. As long as you're sorry.

1094
01:25:31,845 --> 01:25:36,407
I'm out 200 grand, but Ben's sorry!
Everybody hear that? Ben's sorry!

1095
01:25:36,516 --> 01:25:40,577
So, we can all go back to being
friends and laughing over cocktails!

1096
01:25:41,788 --> 01:25:43,153
Come on, Micky.
It can happen to anyone.

1097
01:25:43,256 --> 01:25:44,689
They get on a rush
and they lose control.

1098
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:46,418
You shut your mouth.
This is business.

1099
01:25:46,526 --> 01:25:49,893
Hey, I let you down,
all right? I get it.

1100
01:25:49,996 --> 01:25:53,830
Excuse me? You let me down?
I don't care!

1101
01:25:54,467 --> 01:25:57,595
Let me make one thing clear to you,
I am not your father!

1102
01:25:57,704 --> 01:26:00,730
You are not my friend.
This is a business.

1103
01:26:01,007 --> 01:26:03,134
You are only as good to me
as the money you make,

1104
01:26:03,243 --> 01:26:04,938
and, right now, it's not
worth a hell of a lot!

1105
01:26:05,044 --> 01:26:06,525
You're gonna give me back
everything you lost.

1106
01:26:06,525 --> 01:26:09,644
No, no, no! I can't do that!
That money was for Harvard!

1107
01:26:09,749 --> 01:26:11,649
I have made you so much more
than what I just lost!

1108
01:26:11,751 --> 01:26:13,582
It doesn't matter, Ben.

1109
01:26:13,686 --> 01:26:16,814
You had very clear instructions,
and you didn't follow them.

1110
01:26:16,923 --> 01:26:20,859
You didn't do your job.
You weren't counting, you were gambling!

1111
01:26:23,396 --> 01:26:26,233
Well, why aren't you
out there, then, Micky? Hmm?

1112
01:26:26,866 --> 01:26:31,565
I mean, we take all the risks.
Seems to me like you don't do shit.

1113
01:26:36,276 --> 01:26:38,210
This isn't about me,

1114
01:26:39,045 --> 01:26:42,742
you arrogant little infant.

1115
01:26:55,662 --> 01:26:58,290
You can all find your own way
back to Boston.

1116
01:26:58,398 --> 01:27:02,459
And, Ben, you're gonna pay me that money,
every penny, one way or the other.

1117
01:27:02,569 --> 01:27:04,560
And you damn well
know it.

1118
01:27:14,647 --> 01:27:16,137
I need a drink.

1119
01:27:18,985 --> 01:27:20,418
Anybody else?

1120
01:27:23,456 --> 01:27:25,185
Yeah, well,
we don't need him.

1121
01:27:25,291 --> 01:27:26,952
- Yeah, okay, Ben.
- No, I'm serious.

1122
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:29,722
Why do we need him?
We have our own money now.

1123
01:27:29,829 --> 01:27:33,094
You know, his cut was 50%,
and he doesn't even play!

1124
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:34,826
Why do we need him?

1125
01:27:34,934 --> 01:27:36,026
Hey, you know what I think?

1126
01:27:36,135 --> 01:27:39,468
I think we play out the weekend,
and I think we do this without him.

1127
01:27:39,572 --> 01:27:40,971
No. No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

1128
01:27:41,074 --> 01:27:43,304
I think we should go back
to Boston and figure this out.

1129
01:27:43,409 --> 01:27:45,206
Yeah, well, why don't we
let the team decide?

1130
01:27:45,311 --> 01:27:48,439
I'm with Jill. This is Micky's thing.
Micky brought us together.

1131
01:27:48,548 --> 01:27:50,539
And then he drove us apart.

1132
01:27:50,650 --> 01:27:53,676
I mean, you saw how
he played Fisher against me.

1133
01:27:54,621 --> 01:27:58,250
Choi, what do you say, man?
You wanna make some money?

1134
01:27:59,759 --> 01:28:01,420
- Kind of.
- Really?

1135
01:28:02,195 --> 01:28:05,460
We need 100 grand just to play.
You're talking about risking our own money.

1136
01:28:05,565 --> 01:28:07,062
All I'm saying is
that we try it.

1137
01:28:08,014 --> 01:28:12,635
You know, if... we make the investment,
then we take all of the winnings.

1138
01:28:13,706 --> 01:28:15,003
All of it.

1139
01:28:22,148 --> 01:28:23,445
Okay.

1140
01:28:27,754 --> 01:28:28,812
Yeah.

1141
01:28:29,289 --> 01:28:31,348
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1142
01:28:33,092 --> 01:28:34,286
Choi?

1143
01:28:35,662 --> 01:28:36,924
I'm in.

1144
01:28:38,798 --> 01:28:40,493
Now I need a drink.

1145
01:28:46,472 --> 01:28:48,235
- What are you doing?
- What?

1146
01:28:48,341 --> 01:28:50,309
What are you doing?

1147
01:28:50,410 --> 01:28:52,469
Well, we're printing money.

1148
01:28:52,912 --> 01:28:55,608
What, you think just 'cause Micky
left we're gonna stop?

1149
01:28:55,715 --> 01:28:58,513
No, I could do this.
I can lead this team.

1150
01:28:58,885 --> 01:29:02,150
You know, I'm not the same guy
I was back in Boston.

1151
01:29:02,622 --> 01:29:04,852
- Exactly.
- Yeah, exactly.

1152
01:29:05,358 --> 01:29:07,986
You know, isn't this exactly
who you wanted me to be

1153
01:29:08,094 --> 01:29:11,086
when you first came into
the store to buy a tie?

1154
01:29:15,368 --> 01:29:18,607
What happened to
"300,000 dollars and I'm out"? Hmm?

1155
01:29:18,972 --> 01:29:21,668
What happened to
"A means to an end"?

1156
01:29:22,608 --> 01:29:25,441
How much do you have?
- What?

1157
01:29:25,545 --> 01:29:27,740
- How much do you have?
- I got enough.

1158
01:29:27,847 --> 01:29:30,077
Come on, Ben. How much do you
have saved back in Boston?

1159
01:29:30,183 --> 01:29:32,708
I've got 315 grand,
all right?

1160
01:29:33,086 --> 01:29:35,384
Then why are you still here?

1161
01:29:36,723 --> 01:29:40,682
Because I wanna still be here.
I like being here.

1162
01:29:41,127 --> 01:29:42,992
So does everybody else.

1163
01:29:43,396 --> 01:29:46,092
So, come on, Jill.
Are you in?

1164
01:29:51,971 --> 01:29:54,735
You are the big player, Ben.

1165
01:29:54,841 --> 01:29:56,206
Yes, I am.

1166
01:29:58,644 --> 01:30:00,544
Yeah, can I get a drink?

1167
01:30:28,474 --> 01:30:30,408
Rose, I wanna thank you.

1168
01:30:31,444 --> 01:30:33,810
You have been
most accommodating.

1169
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:36,348
All right, that's for you.

1170
01:30:36,649 --> 01:30:38,947
Okay, take care.
Hey, good luck.

1171
01:30:46,526 --> 01:30:48,517
Hey, how we doing here, people?

1172
01:30:59,839 --> 01:31:03,240
Yeah, I'm gonna put you on hold
while I track him down.

1173
01:31:06,846 --> 01:31:08,973
Just got an interesting call.

1174
01:31:11,084 --> 01:31:15,145
There's nobody left to fire us.
Planet Hollywood is our last client.

1175
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:19,490
I don't know about that.

1176
01:31:25,131 --> 01:31:26,564
This is Cole.

1177
01:31:36,112 --> 01:31:40,141
Ahh, queen of diamonds.
Your lady luck tonight.

1178
01:31:40,646 --> 01:31:42,273
You're doing good.

1179
01:31:42,582 --> 01:31:44,345
You're a real winner.

1180
01:31:49,122 --> 01:31:51,818
Sometimes.
Just like everybody else.

1181
01:31:52,892 --> 01:31:55,087
Now, why don't I believe that?

1182
01:31:57,196 --> 01:31:59,255
Maybe you're just smarter
than everybody else, huh?

1183
01:31:59,365 --> 01:32:02,027
Yeah, I bet it's been
that way your entire life.

1184
01:32:02,135 --> 01:32:05,901
Except it just recently started
paying dividends, am I right?

1185
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:09,005
I'd split them.

1186
01:32:09,108 --> 01:32:13,545
Deck's heavy as hell and since
I've been here, the true count's at plus 7.

1187
01:32:20,353 --> 01:32:22,446
Kianna. I think we have
a serious problem over there.

1188
01:32:22,555 --> 01:32:24,022
- Walk now!
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

1189
01:32:24,123 --> 01:32:27,183
Let's go. I'm out. Thank you.
Let's go, Jill. Let's go.

1190
01:32:27,293 --> 01:32:29,022
I think we need to call
security or something.

1191
01:32:29,128 --> 01:32:32,723
Yeah, I don't think they're gonna help.
Let's go! Come on.

1192
01:32:37,336 --> 01:32:39,304
Let's take a walk, huh?

1193
01:32:40,039 --> 01:32:43,805
Come on, kid. See if we can't
get you that chicken dinner.

1194
01:32:48,981 --> 01:32:51,575
It's called, uh,
biometrics.

1195
01:32:51,684 --> 01:32:55,916
Biometrics. It's sort of like,
uh, a fingerprint of your face.

1196
01:32:58,558 --> 01:33:03,791
See, when the player sits down at
the table, the software, it reads this, uh...

1197
01:33:03,896 --> 01:33:05,363
Biometric profile.

1198
01:33:05,464 --> 01:33:07,227
... biometric profile
of your face,

1199
01:33:07,333 --> 01:33:10,359
cross-references it
with a database of counters.

1200
01:33:13,906 --> 01:33:18,707
Software'll probably put you and me
out of business, but it still can't do this.

1201
01:33:21,881 --> 01:33:23,178
All right.

1202
01:33:27,323 --> 01:33:31,621
Ohh! You understand
all this. You go to MIT.

1203
01:33:31,991 --> 01:33:33,390
Smart boy.

1204
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:36,794
My name is Cole Williams.

1205
01:33:37,396 --> 01:33:40,661
And if I ever see you
in this town again,

1206
01:33:41,434 --> 01:33:44,835
I will break your cheek bone
with a small hammer,

1207
01:33:46,072 --> 01:33:48,063
and then I will kill you.

1208
01:33:52,745 --> 01:33:56,306
Please. Please,
just take the money.

1209
01:33:57,550 --> 01:33:59,074
You can take it.

1210
01:34:01,787 --> 01:34:03,118
Tell me, uh,

1211
01:34:03,689 --> 01:34:08,422
how's... good old
Professor Rosa doing, huh?

1212
01:34:10,096 --> 01:34:14,692
Oh, yeah. Me and Micky,
we go way back.

1213
01:34:15,801 --> 01:34:18,793
I spent years, chased him
all over this town.

1214
01:34:19,238 --> 01:34:24,198
Giving him beat downs left and right,
only to find him at the tables a week later.

1215
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:26,278
He was very persistent.

1216
01:34:27,179 --> 01:34:30,478
And then, one September night,

1217
01:34:30,983 --> 01:34:33,884
when I was in Barstow
at my father's funeral,

1218
01:34:34,754 --> 01:34:38,190
my casino was taken
for seven figures.

1219
01:34:38,291 --> 01:34:39,622
Can you imagine that?

1220
01:34:39,725 --> 01:34:42,956
The most ever taken by
a single counter in one night.

1221
01:34:43,062 --> 01:34:47,658
'Course I was, naturally,
unceremoniously fired.

1222
01:34:50,369 --> 01:34:52,132
Funny thing, though.

1223
01:34:52,538 --> 01:34:55,063
I never saw Micky Rosa
after that.

1224
01:34:56,242 --> 01:34:57,368
Never.

1225
01:36:24,096 --> 01:36:26,223
Cauchy was the first
to make a rigorous study

1226
01:36:26,332 --> 01:36:30,359
of the conditions for convergence
of an infinite series.

1227
01:36:30,469 --> 01:36:32,767
And was concerned with developing

1228
01:36:32,872 --> 01:36:37,741
the basic theorems of the calculus
as rigorously as possible.

1229
01:36:39,145 --> 01:36:40,578
Any questions?

1230
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:43,107
No? All right, moving on.

1231
01:36:44,150 --> 01:36:48,143
Isn't it true Cauchy
stole from his students?

1232
01:36:53,058 --> 01:36:56,926
Yes, I heard that.
What's your theory on that?

1233
01:36:57,963 --> 01:37:02,491
They say he used his students
for their brilliance,

1234
01:37:03,636 --> 01:37:07,868
then discredited them
and stole their equations,

1235
01:37:09,942 --> 01:37:11,807
stole their hard work.

1236
01:37:14,513 --> 01:37:17,209
Well, that wouldn't be the first time
a teacher was accused of that.

1237
01:37:17,316 --> 01:37:22,015
I think what he's referring to
is Vladimir Stupnitsky, yes?

1238
01:37:22,121 --> 01:37:25,056
He was a student of Cauchy's
who accused Cauchy

1239
01:37:25,157 --> 01:37:28,490
of stealing his four-volume text
on this analysis

1240
01:37:28,594 --> 01:37:31,062
and publishing it
under a pseudonym.

1241
01:37:32,898 --> 01:37:34,559
Of course, nobody knows
what really went down there.

1242
01:37:34,667 --> 01:37:38,660
They never did prove it, and without
the proof, it's a little like it never happened.

1243
01:37:38,771 --> 01:37:40,796
And, you know,
it's a real shame,

1244
01:37:40,906 --> 01:37:45,104
because if Stupnitsky had just realized
that he shouldn't have crossed Cauchy,

1245
01:37:45,211 --> 01:37:46,940
this was the dispute,

1246
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:53,976
if he'd been able to... get beyond some
of the personal mistakes that were made,

1247
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:57,751
I have no doubt that Cauchy
would have worked with him again,

1248
01:37:57,857 --> 01:38:00,883
and they could have
done great things together.

1249
01:38:01,293 --> 01:38:05,354
But, as history shows us,
some students never learn.

1250
01:38:07,066 --> 01:38:08,727
You should get
that eye looked at.

1251
01:38:45,938 --> 01:38:47,337
You okay?

1252
01:38:50,309 --> 01:38:51,936
Everything's gone.

1253
01:38:53,746 --> 01:38:56,340
- What?
- Micky's taken everything.

1254
01:38:56,448 --> 01:39:00,680
He's taken the money,
taken away Harvard Med, even MIT.

1255
01:39:02,555 --> 01:39:04,648
- What are you talking about?
- Micky, he's taken everything.

1256
01:39:04,757 --> 01:39:07,157
I-I-I gotta find a way
to get it back.

1257
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:09,950
Are you insane?

1258
01:39:10,563 --> 01:39:14,124
You just got the shit kicked out
of you and you won't let this go!

1259
01:39:14,233 --> 01:39:18,169
Look, what am I supposed to do, Jill?
I've just lost everything!

1260
01:39:18,938 --> 01:39:20,428
Look, please...

1261
01:39:22,241 --> 01:39:24,505
I don't wanna lose you, too.

1262
01:39:27,513 --> 01:39:31,108
Ben, you were
dragged away in Vegas.

1263
01:39:31,784 --> 01:39:36,118
I haven't heard from you.
I had no idea where you were.

1264
01:39:36,822 --> 01:39:38,050
I know.

1265
01:39:39,024 --> 01:39:40,184
I know.

1266
01:39:47,533 --> 01:39:50,331
You know, I'm so sorry
that I hurt you.

1267
01:39:52,137 --> 01:39:53,502
I'm sorry.

1268
01:39:56,375 --> 01:40:00,869
In Vegas, I don't know
what happened. That wasn't me.

1269
01:40:02,081 --> 01:40:03,708
Look, you know me.

1270
01:40:04,416 --> 01:40:06,281
You know what I'm like.

1271
01:40:08,087 --> 01:40:09,577
You know me.

1272
01:40:16,028 --> 01:40:17,893
I need you to trust me.

1273
01:40:19,231 --> 01:40:22,598
<i>And the winner of this year's 2.09</i>

1274
01:40:22,701 --> 01:40:28,970
<i>for excellence in the field of robotics
goes to the team of Connolly and Kazazi!</i>

1275
01:41:06,345 --> 01:41:09,314
That's it. That's...
that's the story.

1276
01:41:11,817 --> 01:41:14,047
Jill Taylor. Really?

1277
01:41:14,853 --> 01:41:18,345
- Yeah. Yeah, really.
- Wow.

1278
01:41:18,457 --> 01:41:22,655
Yeah, it doesn't feel like "wow," Miles.
I really screwed up.

1279
01:41:22,761 --> 01:41:27,494
Yeah, you did.
But... you had a life experience.

1280
01:41:31,937 --> 01:41:33,928
I-I can't believe
how I treated you, Miles.

1281
01:41:34,039 --> 01:41:37,941
You know, you're my best friend,
and I... really let you down.

1282
01:41:38,811 --> 01:41:41,905
I really let you down.
I'm sorry.

1283
01:41:43,716 --> 01:41:48,244
And I'm-I'm happy for you, you know?
Winning the 2.09? That's... that's great.

1284
01:41:49,621 --> 01:41:52,089
- Jill Taylor, really?!
- Yeah.

1285
01:41:54,626 --> 01:41:56,719
So, let me get
this straight.

1286
01:41:57,396 --> 01:42:00,559
Money, girls,

1287
01:42:01,734 --> 01:42:06,137
high-roller suites,
clubs, Vegas.

1288
01:42:07,339 --> 01:42:12,367
Yeah, I think I probably would have
blown off the 2.09 Competition, too.

1289
01:42:15,914 --> 01:42:17,279
So, we cool?

1290
01:42:18,917 --> 01:42:20,509
Yeah, we're cool.

1291
01:42:21,019 --> 01:42:23,715
But you better believe that you're
gonna make this up to me big time.

1292
01:42:23,822 --> 01:42:25,084
All right.

1293
01:42:26,391 --> 01:42:28,518
So, what are you
gonna do now?

1294
01:43:19,311 --> 01:43:21,142
What do you want, Ben?
This is an alumni dinner.

1295
01:43:21,246 --> 01:43:23,612
You need a diploma
to come to one of these.

1296
01:43:23,715 --> 01:43:26,115
Wait. Stupnitsky wants back in.

1297
01:43:32,324 --> 01:43:33,291
What?

1298
01:43:33,392 --> 01:43:37,522
Look, I... I've... I've had some time
to think about what you said.

1299
01:43:39,398 --> 01:43:40,888
I want back in.

1300
01:43:41,867 --> 01:43:45,735
- Why now?
- Because I have nothing else.

1301
01:43:47,606 --> 01:43:50,803
All right, look, Ben. I'm not gonna lie to you.
You're good, you're very, very good.

1302
01:43:50,909 --> 01:43:55,073
But you did exactly what I told you not to.
You got emotional and then you got stupid.

1303
01:43:55,180 --> 01:43:58,877
Now you tell me why in the world
I'd ever get back in business with you.

1304
01:43:58,984 --> 01:44:03,444
Look, I know I should never have
disrespected you, all right? I know that.

1305
01:44:04,423 --> 01:44:06,391
With this facial
recognition software,

1306
01:44:06,491 --> 01:44:09,688
our window of opportunity
is closing in on us.

1307
01:44:10,229 --> 01:44:13,892
Now, I need this, Micky.
I really, really need this.

1308
01:44:13,999 --> 01:44:19,130
Well, the take would have to be really, really
good to get me even vaguely interested.

1309
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:25,941
Well, you know, that's... that's why I was
thinking maybe you should be the other big player.

1310
01:44:27,346 --> 01:44:30,679
You know,
two big players playing big?

1311
01:44:31,850 --> 01:44:35,183
Hey, slow down,
I haven't played in a long time, Ben.

1312
01:44:39,625 --> 01:44:41,217
But Fisher's out.

1313
01:44:42,094 --> 01:44:46,463
No one else on the team
can... be the big player, can they?

1314
01:44:49,701 --> 01:44:53,102
And if we do well,
if we do really well,

1315
01:44:53,872 --> 01:44:57,035
then you get your grades back,
get to Harvard Med,

1316
01:44:58,043 --> 01:45:00,568
and I might even
get that sabbatical.

1317
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:06,040
Well, amazing things can be done
from the inside, right?

1318
01:45:07,986 --> 01:45:10,682
Just went back to
the head of the class.

1319
01:45:11,957 --> 01:45:13,822
I gotta go be social.

1320
01:45:19,197 --> 01:45:22,496
All right, now listen.
It's different out there this time.

1321
01:45:22,601 --> 01:45:25,468
The stakes are high
and it's more dangerous.

1322
01:45:26,004 --> 01:45:29,064
But the return...
is gonna be the biggest.

1323
01:45:30,375 --> 01:45:33,811
Now, they know our faces,
so we're gonna wear disguises.

1324
01:45:34,046 --> 01:45:36,014
And we can't mess around.

1325
01:45:36,381 --> 01:45:37,848
I'm glad you're
back with us, Micky.

1326
01:45:37,950 --> 01:45:39,850
Well, I couldn't let you guys
come back to this town

1327
01:45:39,952 --> 01:45:43,444
and not prove to Ben that
I can do more than just teach.

1328
01:45:44,289 --> 01:45:48,191
But as we've all said, this game
is about the past and the future,

1329
01:45:48,293 --> 01:45:51,353
and tonight
we forget about the past.

1330
01:45:51,596 --> 01:45:53,461
We just focus on the future.

1331
01:45:53,565 --> 01:45:56,898
Right. This is our last time.

1332
01:45:57,302 --> 01:46:00,328
Now, we all know the drill if things get ugly.
We meet at the Fox Strip Club.

1333
01:46:00,439 --> 01:46:02,771
Nobody leaves this town alone.

1334
01:46:06,244 --> 01:46:08,144
Let's go make a killing.

1335
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:10,045
All right.

1336
01:46:32,170 --> 01:46:34,638
Let's see what we can do with this.

1337
01:46:43,749 --> 01:46:47,810
Seems like I'm having one of those days,
you know what I mean, Jim?

1338
01:46:49,488 --> 01:46:51,615
I'm bringing all the luck today.
I'm just bringing it all.

1339
01:46:51,723 --> 01:46:56,183
Anyone who's in any kind of contact
with me is getting so much luck today.

1340
01:47:07,839 --> 01:47:10,000
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner! There it is.

1341
01:47:10,108 --> 01:47:13,544
Thank you. God, I love this town.
I love this game.

1342
01:47:14,346 --> 01:47:17,645
And, Jim, I might
even love you.

1343
01:47:27,459 --> 01:47:29,654
Hey, you mind if I sit down?

1344
01:47:43,675 --> 01:47:44,733
What's your name?

1345
01:47:44,843 --> 01:47:47,971
Shane? I'm about to change your luck.
It's gonna become mine.

1346
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:50,310
There you go,
give me it all.

1347
01:48:00,358 --> 01:48:01,552
There you go.

1348
01:48:04,329 --> 01:48:06,092
Thank you. Thank you.

1349
01:48:10,836 --> 01:48:13,066
Such a shame, Shane!

1350
01:48:14,039 --> 01:48:16,098
Okay, I'm supposed to double, right?

1351
01:48:16,208 --> 01:48:20,542
- Is this your first time, darling?
- I've been winning and losing for hours.

1352
01:48:20,645 --> 01:48:22,738
Well, that's all right.
I've been winning and losing for years.

1353
01:48:36,061 --> 01:48:37,585
What the hell kind of streak
are you on, boy?

1354
01:48:37,696 --> 01:48:40,358
This never happens,
this never happens.

1355
01:48:53,411 --> 01:48:55,208
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.

1356
01:48:55,313 --> 01:48:56,871
- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens!

1357
01:48:56,982 --> 01:48:58,116
- Split tens!
- Again!

1358
01:48:58,116 --> 01:48:58,844
- Split tens!
- Again!

1359
01:49:21,773 --> 01:49:24,742
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Give me the chips, Blanca.

1360
01:49:25,977 --> 01:49:27,842
Give me the chips!
Come on, give me the chips, Blanca.

1361
01:49:27,946 --> 01:49:30,847
Come on,
just give me the chips!

1362
01:49:30,949 --> 01:49:35,079
- My bus has to leave right away.
- I gotta walk my dog.

1363
01:49:35,187 --> 01:49:37,747
- I'm sorry we're making such a mess.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

1364
01:49:37,856 --> 01:49:40,916
Nice to see you.
Have a good night, darling.

1365
01:49:46,464 --> 01:49:47,761
This way!

1366
01:49:58,977 --> 01:50:00,069
Go.

1367
01:50:14,426 --> 01:50:15,791
This way!

1368
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:23,691
Come on, Jill.
Come on!

1369
01:50:33,612 --> 01:50:36,206
Go that way. Throw me the chips.
Come on, we gotta separate.

1370
01:50:36,314 --> 01:50:39,181
Give me the chips,
I'll meet you at Fox's.

1371
01:50:45,257 --> 01:50:46,849
Go, go, go, go!

1372
01:50:57,802 --> 01:50:59,463
Come on, come on.

1373
01:51:02,574 --> 01:51:04,132
Move, move, move!

1374
01:51:08,313 --> 01:51:09,575
Come on.

1375
01:51:10,715 --> 01:51:12,307
Go, go, this way.

1376
01:51:24,296 --> 01:51:26,127
All right, let's go.

1377
01:51:34,205 --> 01:51:36,696
Go, go, go, go!
Airport!

1378
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:56,887
<i>I never saw Micky Rosa
after that.</i>

1379
01:52:01,966 --> 01:52:03,228
Oh, God.

1380
01:52:04,336 --> 01:52:06,600
But I think
I wanna see him now.

1381
01:52:07,672 --> 01:52:10,140
And I want you
to make that happen.

1382
01:52:14,412 --> 01:52:16,846
I-I don't work
for Micky anymore.

1383
01:52:19,851 --> 01:52:21,284
Come on, kid.

1384
01:52:23,121 --> 01:52:26,887
Your picture's all over the database.
Your Vegas gig is done.

1385
01:52:27,926 --> 01:52:29,860
But I will give you
one night.

1386
01:52:29,961 --> 01:52:33,021
And I can guarantee
that you won't be bothered.

1387
01:52:33,932 --> 01:52:37,698
You'll make a killing,
and you'll keep it all.

1388
01:52:40,772 --> 01:52:41,966
Listen.

1389
01:52:43,541 --> 01:52:45,008
My name's Cole.

1390
01:52:46,578 --> 01:52:48,102
Cole Williams.

1391
01:52:50,014 --> 01:52:52,414
You just bring me
Micky Rosa, kid.

1392
01:52:52,717 --> 01:52:54,742
I'll take care of the rest.

1393
01:52:57,288 --> 01:53:00,223
Son of a bitch.

1394
01:53:42,867 --> 01:53:44,630
Who the hell are you?

1395
01:54:07,492 --> 01:54:10,655
Ben. Good job.

1396
01:54:11,729 --> 01:54:16,792
You'll be glad to know I'm gonna have a talk
with your professor, and that MIT thing?

1397
01:54:17,001 --> 01:54:19,094
It's gonna
work out for you.

1398
01:54:20,672 --> 01:54:22,230
So, that's it?

1399
01:54:23,675 --> 01:54:26,439
- That's it.
- All right.

1400
01:54:27,412 --> 01:54:29,107
Oh, dr. Campbell?

1401
01:54:30,448 --> 01:54:33,417
They don't have pensions
in my line of work.

1402
01:54:33,751 --> 01:54:35,651
And the software does
what it's supposed to do.

1403
01:54:35,753 --> 01:54:39,655
And I been chasing Micky Rosa
around here for too damn long.

1404
01:54:40,892 --> 01:54:43,156
I'm looking at
some retirement.

1405
01:54:45,063 --> 01:54:46,530
Leave the bag.

1406
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:50,898
No. No, no, no, no.

1407
01:54:51,002 --> 01:54:55,496
I need this money. You have no idea
what I went through to get this money.

1408
01:54:55,607 --> 01:55:00,601
I know, kid, but you're gonna figure out
how to get everything you want in this life,

1409
01:55:00,712 --> 01:55:02,441
'cause you're smart.

1410
01:55:04,015 --> 01:55:08,543
So, you're gonna
leave the bag.

1411
01:55:13,591 --> 01:55:18,187
Ben, give him the bag. Give him the bag.
It doesn't matter. Give him the bag.

1412
01:55:27,038 --> 01:55:28,835
I knew you were smart.

1413
01:55:47,692 --> 01:55:50,422
<i>I had a 1590 on my SAT.</i>

1414
01:55:50,528 --> 01:55:52,587
<i>I got a 44 on my MCATs.</i>

1415
01:55:53,097 --> 01:55:56,225
<i>And I have
a 4.0 GPA from MIT.</i>

1416
01:55:56,334 --> 01:55:58,802
<i>I thought I had
my life mapped out.</i>

1417
01:56:00,705 --> 01:56:01,797
<i>But then I remembered</i>

1418
01:56:01,906 --> 01:56:05,364
<i>what my Nonlinear Equations
professor once told me,</i>

1419
01:56:05,910 --> 01:56:09,141
<i>"Always account
for variable change."</i>

1420
01:56:10,949 --> 01:56:12,473
Hello, Micky.

1421
01:56:14,185 --> 01:56:16,016
Look, I got money in Boston.
A hundred grand.

1422
01:56:16,120 --> 01:56:18,145
I'll give it to you.
Just let me walk away. I'll walk away.

1423
01:56:18,256 --> 01:56:21,316
I don't want your money,
Micky. I don't need it.

1424
01:56:27,131 --> 01:56:29,929
But I know someone
who might be interested.

1425
01:56:30,301 --> 01:56:34,397
He's good with numbers, too.
He works for the IRS.

1426
01:56:43,214 --> 01:56:45,273
<i>I let down my good friends.</i>

1427
01:56:45,950 --> 01:56:50,887
<i>But as it turns out, they weren't
too bad at simple math either.</i>

1428
01:57:16,714 --> 01:57:19,274
<i>I scored the prettiest girl
in school.</i>

1429
01:57:22,754 --> 01:57:25,382
<i>I got beaten down
by an old-school Vegas thug</i>

1430
01:57:25,490 --> 01:57:28,687
<i>who was having trouble
accepting his retirement.</i>

1431
01:57:29,994 --> 01:57:33,760
<i>But I worked out a deal with him
that got him a nice pension.</i>

1432
01:57:37,135 --> 01:57:39,933
<i>And... I lied to my mother.</i>

1433
01:57:40,405 --> 01:57:44,102
<i>But I confessed the lie,
and, well, she still loved me.</i>

1434
01:58:00,625 --> 01:58:03,890
<i>So, my senior year of college,
I joined this team.</i>

1435
01:58:04,295 --> 01:58:06,456
<i>And I learned
this new skill.</i>

1436
01:58:06,698 --> 01:58:09,724
<i>I went to Vegas
17 times to use it.</i>

1437
01:58:11,903 --> 01:58:15,430
<i>I made hundreds of thousands
of dollars counting cards.</i>

1438
01:58:16,474 --> 01:58:19,034
And then I had it all stolen from me.

1439
01:58:19,977 --> 01:58:21,137
Twice.

1440
01:58:22,447 --> 01:58:26,543
How's that for life experience,
professor? Did I dazzle you?

1441
01:58:27,719 --> 01:58:30,557
Did I... jump off the page?
