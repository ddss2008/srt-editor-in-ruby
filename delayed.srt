<i>"Winner, winner,
chicken dinner."</i>

2
59:58:52,761 --> 59:58:56,253
<i>Those words had been dancing
around my head all night.</i>

3
59:58:57,298 --> 59:58:59,630
<i>I mean, it's Vegas lore,
that phrase.</i>

4
59:59:00,435 --> 59:59:03,836
<i>Just ask any of the old-time
pit bosses, they'll know.</i>

5
59:59:07,075 --> 59:59:11,512
<i>It was a Chinese dealer at Binion's
who was first credited with the line.</i>

6
59:59:12,280 --> 59:59:15,249
<i>He would shout it every time
he dealt blackjack.</i>

7
59:59:15,350 --> 59:59:18,808
<i>That was over 40 years ago,
and the words still catch.</i>

8
59:59:18,920 --> 59:59:20,911
<i>Winner, winner, chicken dinner.
There it is!</i>

9
59:59:21,022 --> 59:59:23,388
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."</i>

10
59:59:24,559 --> 59:59:25,992
<i>Yeah, try it.</i>

11
59:59:28,263 --> 59:59:31,255
<i>I had heard it at least
14 times that night.</i>

12
59:59:31,933 --> 59:59:33,491
<i>I couldn't lose.</i>

13
59:59:34,769 --> 59:59:37,670
<i>First of all, what
I was doing wasn't illegal.</i>

14
59:59:37,839 --> 59:59:41,002
<i>There were certain institutions
and people that frowned upon it,</i>

15
59:59:41,109 --> 59:59:43,270
<i>but it's legal.</i>

16
59:59:43,378 --> 59:59:45,141
<i>And not everyone can do it.</i>

17
59:59:45,246 --> 59:59:47,407
<i>Just those with gifted minds.</i>

18
59:59:47,682 --> 59:59:49,547
<i>I have a gifted mind.</i>

19
59:59:50,085 --> 59:59:52,679
<i>That's what got me
into all this mess.</i>

20
59:59:53,254 --> 59:59:58,282
<i>I was counting cards
and I was up over 640,000 dollars.</i>

21
00:00:00,161 --> 00:00:03,153
All right! I'm just gonna have
to split those tens.

22
00:00:03,264 --> 00:00:05,994
- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens again.

23
00:00:06,101 --> 00:00:08,069
Well, that's all right.
I've been winning and losing for years.

<i>We used hand signals, too.</i>

<i>A touch to the eye,
we need to talk.</i>

27
00:00:16,778 --> 00:00:21,875
<i>And a hand, running through
perfect flowing hair, meant only one thing.</i>

00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,211

TA to Professors Wilkins
and Sanders.

Both of whom are friends of mine,
and who wrote glowing recommendations.

38
00:03:29,037 --> 00:03:32,063
And you're accepted early into school
here at Harvard Med,

39
00:03:32,173 --> 00:03:35,108
pending graduation from MIT.
It's very impressive.

40
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:36,176
Thank you.

41
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:39,508
The Robinson Scholarship
is comprehensive, as you know.

42
00:03:39,614 --> 00:03:43,050
It's a free ride. And
free rides don't come easy.

43
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:44,140
Absolutely.

44
00:03:44,252 --> 00:03:49,349
We have 76 applicants this year,
only one of whom will get the scholarship

45
00:03:49,457 --> 00:03:53,052
and most of whom have résumés
just as impressive as yours.

46
00:03:53,995 --> 00:03:55,155
Right.

47
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:57,925
Uh, Professor Phillips?

48
00:03:58,118 --> 00:04:02,135
Uh, some kids... grow up
wanting to play for the Red Sox.

49
00:04:02,236 --> 00:04:06,195
You know, some grow up wanting to be,
I don't know, a fireman.

50
00:04:06,741 --> 00:04:11,701
I grew up, uh... Well, really, I just
wanted to come here to Harvard Med.

51
00:04:12,814 --> 00:04:18,411
And now that I've gotten accepted,
it seems to only come down to the money.

52
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:21,578
Which I don't really have.

53
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:27,587
So, what-what I'm trying to say

54
00:04:27,695 --> 00:04:32,029
is that I really, really
need this scholarship.

55
00:04:34,736 --> 00:04:36,465
Did you rehearse that?

56
00:04:36,571 --> 00:04:39,938
Yeah. Like, 14 times
in front of the mirror.

57
00:04:41,609 --> 00:04:44,976
Unfortunately, desire
doesn't figure into this much.

58
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,215
The Robinson is going
to go to someone who...

59
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:52,981
dazzles.

60
00:04:54,122 --> 00:04:57,614
Somebody who just...
jumps off the page.

61
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:02,528
Oh, well, then, uh, I'm also
involved in a science competition.

62
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,359
We're building a robotic wheel

63
00:05:04,465 --> 00:05:08,663
that can navigate itself, uh,
using a proprietary GPS system.

64
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:12,871
Well, I'm designing
the system. So...

65
00:05:12,974 --> 00:05:14,100
Right.

66
00:05:14,642 --> 00:05:18,043
Ben, last year, the Robinson
went to Hyum Jae Wook,

67
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:21,115
a Korean immigrant
who has only one leg.

68
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,313
Well, I-I have both my legs.

69
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,548
Well, have you considered
cutting one of them off?

70
00:05:29,857 --> 00:05:31,415
That was a joke.

71
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,327
Ben, it's all about the essay.

72
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:37,421
You need to really explain to us
what makes you special.

73
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:40,865
What life experience separates
you from all the rest.

74
00:05:41,869 --> 00:05:43,461
Life experience.

75
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:46,268
What can you tell me, Ben,

76
00:05:46,374 --> 00:05:49,002
that's going
to dazzle me?

77
00:06:13,835 --> 00:06:14,859
I'm so sorry
I'm late.

78
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:18,234
- Where is your jacket?
- Oh, I got it. I got it. It's right here.

79
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:21,900
This is no way for the new
assistant manager to come to work.

80
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:25,410
Congratulations.
How does 8 dollars an hour sound?

81
00:06:25,513 --> 00:06:26,980
Eight dollars?

82
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:32,350
Wow! Wow. That's-that's great,
Warren. Thank you. Thank you.

83
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:36,251
You slept with him,
didn't you?

84
00:06:36,507 --> 00:06:37,586
- Uhh, yes, I did.
- Yes, you did.

85
00:06:37,586 --> 00:06:42,010
- Yes, I did.
- I'll sleep with him, too, and I'll get $8 an hour.

86
00:06:42,163 --> 00:06:45,291
So, Palmer finishes up his lecture,
right? And I say to him,

87
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:49,130
" Well, Professor Palmer, you're gonna need
at least 14 capacitance probes

88
00:06:49,237 --> 00:06:51,330
" to get the kind of results
that you're looking for, okay?"

89
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,375
So, then he says to me, "Miles,
don't you think that's a little excessive?"

90
00:06:55,476 --> 00:07:00,573
And I get up, I swear to God, Ben, I get up
in front of the entire class and I say,

91
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:03,946
" You can never have
enough capacitance probes."

92
00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:09,852
Oh, my God. What the hell
is wrong with you?

93
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,690
Huh? Oh, nothing.

94
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:16,294
I hope nothing. You just got
promoted, man. You should be happy.

95
00:07:16,397 --> 00:07:21,528
I just gotta write this essay for the
Robinson Scholarship, and I have nothing.

96
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:26,666
And the reason that I have nothing
is 'cause, well, I've done nothing.

97
00:07:26,774 --> 00:07:29,470
- Oh, gimme a break, Ben.
- What?

98
00:07:29,577 --> 00:07:31,306
You've everything.

99
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:36,172
You blow me out of the water,
and I'm a cerebral stud. Is that nothing?

100
00:07:36,284 --> 00:07:37,546
Yeah, well,
it doesn't dazzle.

101
00:07:37,652 --> 00:07:39,916
Hey. It dazzles me, mister.

102
00:07:40,621 --> 00:07:42,953
You know, ever since I was 16,
I crushed exams.

103
00:07:43,057 --> 00:07:46,424
I-I took on extracurriculars.
I showed up early.

104
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:49,428
I even sat up at the front
and I stayed late.

105
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,498
Man, I gave up everything.

106
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:54,266
You know, I gave up fun.
I gave up sex.

107
00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:56,029
I don't think
you gave up sex.

108
00:07:56,137 --> 00:07:58,367
- Okay. Maybe not sex.
- Yeah, you didn't give up sex.

109
00:07:58,472 --> 00:08:00,167
All right, all right.
Not sex, but...

110
00:08:00,274 --> 00:08:02,265
It just annoys me
that the one thing

111
00:08:02,376 --> 00:08:05,311
that is stopping me from
going to Harvard Med is money.

112
00:08:05,413 --> 00:08:09,645
You know, tuition fees and living expenses
alone cost over 300,000 dollars.

113
00:08:10,484 --> 00:08:12,543
300,000 dollars.

114
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:15,952
It's outrageous. It's-it's-it's
astronomically high. I get that.

115
00:08:16,057 --> 00:08:19,959
You know, I just thought
there was more to life than just money.

116
00:08:22,363 --> 00:08:24,524
Well, look at the bright side,

117
00:08:25,032 --> 00:08:28,195
I just saved a bunch of money
on my car insurance.

118
00:08:38,446 --> 00:08:39,606
Thank you.

119
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,475
- Happy birthday, honey.
- Thanks, mom.

120
00:08:44,585 --> 00:08:45,882
Thank you, love.
Kisses.

121
00:08:45,987 --> 00:08:47,215
Make a wish.

122
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:48,618
- Make a wish.
- Okay.

123
00:08:50,558 --> 00:08:51,957
Bravo.

124
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:53,390
Congratulations, Benjamin.

125
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:56,292
Did you know Miles did the frosting
on that? You see that?

126
00:08:56,397 --> 00:08:59,560
It took me five minutes
to figure out it was a Fibonacci series...

127
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:02,659
Where the next number is 21.
Now you're slipping, Cam.

128
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,294
Cam, you owe
another six bucks.

129
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:06,032
No, no. I didn't eat
any of the Buffalo wings.

130
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,608
Oh, really? That's great.
Well, we're not doing it that way.

131
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:10,973
We're just dividing equally.
So, let's say you pay.

132
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:14,104
I got it, all right?
No, no. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

133
00:09:14,215 --> 00:09:17,412
It's your birthday.
You're as broke-ass as I am.

134
00:09:17,518 --> 00:09:20,453
I just wish now
I had eaten some of those wings.

135
00:09:20,554 --> 00:09:23,921
So, I nailed the specs
on the 2.09 last night,

136
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:26,391
after 19 cups of coffee.

137
00:09:26,494 --> 00:09:29,520
Check it out.
- You are kidding. You're kidding!

138
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,790
This is good.
Miles, this is-this is good.

139
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:38,133
Yeah, well, it better be 'cause this is what
we've been working for since we got here.

140
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:39,570
This is called destiny.

141
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:41,471
You know, there is the poss...
Thank you.

142
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:45,238
There is the possibility that
we might not actually win this thing.

143
00:09:45,346 --> 00:09:48,747
Oh, yeah? Bite your tongue!
Bite your damn tongue!

144
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:51,147
Look, guys,

145
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:57,883
we don't date, we don't travel,
we don't have any money.

146
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,552
The only thing that we do have
is the 2.09 Competition.

147
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,999
If we can't even win that,
what's the point?

148
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:10,504
Hey, hey. Look at this!

149
00:10:11,038 --> 00:10:12,699
No, no, no, no.

150
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:20,007
-Yeah.
- We... suck.

151
00:10:26,854 --> 00:10:29,618
Your father would be
so proud of you, Ben.

152
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:32,417
Yeah.

153
00:10:34,328 --> 00:10:36,796
Do you remember
anything about him?

154
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:41,565
Not really.
Maybe... when he shaved?

155
00:10:42,436 --> 00:10:44,802
Yeah, I think
I watched him shave.

156
00:10:47,074 --> 00:10:49,804
So, what are your plans
for the rest of the night?

157
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,641
I don't know. I'll probably just
go back and work on that essay.

158
00:10:53,748 --> 00:10:55,716
Ben, you're working
too hard.

159
00:10:55,816 --> 00:11:00,515
Between the job and school and the 2.09,
you've had no time for just... yourself.

160
00:11:01,088 --> 00:11:04,421
You have to squeeze in
a little time for fun, Ben.

161
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:08,552
You only turn 21 once.
And it goes by very fast.

162
00:11:08,662 --> 00:11:10,892
Okay. All right.

163
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,860
- Good night.
- All right, good night.

164
00:11:13,968 --> 00:11:16,835
- Don't come home before 3:00.
- All right.

165
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:22,903
All right.

166
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:27,606
Now, who can explain Newton's
method and how you use it?

167
00:11:27,882 --> 00:11:31,608
Uh, you can use it
to solve nonlinear equations.

168
00:11:33,487 --> 00:11:36,945
That's impressive. That's-that's really good.
I mean, I'm very impressed by that,

169
00:11:37,057 --> 00:11:40,549
especially since my class
is called Nonlinear Equations.

170
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:44,887
All right, now somebody tell me
something I don't already know.

171
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:46,125
Anyone?

172
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:48,793
Bueller. Anyone?
Bueller.

173
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:51,029
Newton stole it.

174
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:54,132
- I'm sorry?
- Newton stole it.

175
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:59,411
Joseph Raphson published
this same method 50 years earlier.

176
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,449
And if the start value is too far removed
from true zero, then... it fails.

177
00:12:04,752 --> 00:12:08,347
- I'm sorry, what's your name?
- Ben. Ben Campbell.

178
00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:09,480
Ben.

179
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,423
So, Ben Campbell suggests
that Joseph Raphson

180
00:12:12,526 --> 00:12:14,221
was the original author
of this method.

181
00:12:14,328 --> 00:12:16,421
Well, if that's the case,
then why didn't he get any credit?

182
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,761
Well, for one thing,
Newton had a better publicist.

183
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:23,232
And for another, after 1700,
we know very little about Raphson

184
00:12:23,337 --> 00:12:27,899
other than the fact that he discovered the
Kabbalah about 300 years before Madonna.

185
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:31,205
All right, now, let's give Ben a chance
for some extra credit, shall we?

186
00:12:31,312 --> 00:12:35,715
We're gonna call this, um,
the game show host problem, all right?

187
00:12:35,816 --> 00:12:37,841
Ben, suppose you're
on a game show.

188
00:12:37,952 --> 00:12:41,444
And you are given a chance to choose
from three different doors, all right?

189
00:12:41,555 --> 00:12:46,458
Now, behind one of the doors is a new car.
Behind the other two, goats.

190
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,960
Which door
would you choose, Ben?

191
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:50,420
Uh, door number one?

192
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:52,328
Door number one.
Ben chooses door number one.

193
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:54,424
All right, now,
the game show host,

194
00:12:54,535 --> 00:12:57,504
who, by the way, knows
what's behind all the other doors,

195
00:12:57,605 --> 00:13:01,803
decides to open another door.
Let's say he chooses door number three.

196
00:13:01,976 --> 00:13:05,810
Behind which sits a goat.
Now...

197
00:13:05,913 --> 00:13:07,710
Ben, game show host
comes up to you.

198
00:13:07,815 --> 00:13:10,215
He says, " Ben, do you wanna
stay with door number one

199
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:11,648
" or go with door
number two?"

200
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:15,210
Now, is it in your interest
to switch your choice?

201
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,414
- Yeah.
- Well, wait.

202
00:13:17,525 --> 00:13:19,618
Remember, the host knows
where the car is

203
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:22,161
so, how do you know
he's not playing a trick on you?

204
00:13:22,263 --> 00:13:25,130
Trying to use reverse psychology
to get you to pick a goat?

205
00:13:25,232 --> 00:13:29,464
Well, I wouldn't really care.
I mean, my answer's based on statistics.

206
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,538
Based on variable change.

207
00:13:32,706 --> 00:13:35,072
Variable change? But he just
asked you a simple question.

208
00:13:35,175 --> 00:13:37,439
Yeah, which changed everything.

209
00:13:37,711 --> 00:13:39,076
Enlighten us.

210
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:42,444
Well, when I was originally
asked to choose a door,

211
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,008
I had a 33.3% chance
of choosing right.

212
00:13:46,554 --> 00:13:50,217
But after he opens one of the doors
and then re-offers me the choice,

213
00:13:50,324 --> 00:13:54,522
it's now 66.7%
if I choose to switch.

214
00:13:54,628 --> 00:14:00,328
So, yeah, I'll take door number two,
and thank you for that extra 33.3%.

215
00:14:02,937 --> 00:14:04,063
Exactly.

216
00:14:04,171 --> 00:14:05,365
People, remember,

217
00:14:05,472 --> 00:14:09,704
if you don't know which door to open,
always account for variable change.

218
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,903
Now, see, most people
wouldn't take the switch

219
00:14:12,012 --> 00:14:15,504
out of paranoia,
fear, emotions.

220
00:14:15,616 --> 00:14:18,517
But Mr. Campbell,
he kept emotions aside

221
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:25,449
and let simple math get
his ass into a brand-new car!

222
00:14:26,694 --> 00:14:28,821
Which is better than that goat
you've been driving around campus.

223
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:29,987
All right, everybody.

224
00:14:30,097 --> 00:14:31,496
That's the end of the day.
Thank you very much.

225
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:33,157
Your graded papers are
down here at the end.

226
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:35,792
You can pick them
up on your way out.

227
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:47,874
I am invincible.

228
00:14:54,822 --> 00:14:57,313
Guys, Jill Taylor,
10 o'clock.

229
00:15:12,106 --> 00:15:13,937
Oh, man.
That's brutal.

230
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,043
You know, you should
just ask her out, man.

231
00:15:19,146 --> 00:15:21,637
It's not like she's a rocket
scientist or anything.

232
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:23,341
Oh, wait, she is.

233
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,509
Well, why don't
you ask her?

234
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:29,281
Because... I'm, uh,
I'm already dating someone.

235
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,181
Yeah, your right hand
doesn't count, Miles.

236
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:35,591
It does the way I use it.
It does the way I use it.

237
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:41,290
Hey, you know what? Maybe
I don't even wanna go out with her.

238
00:15:43,037 --> 00:15:44,800
Yeah, that's funny.

239
00:15:46,473 --> 00:15:49,738
You know, you say
you want a life experience, right?

240
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:54,444
Well, I'd say getting down
with that would definitely qualify.

241
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:56,443
Cam!

242
00:16:17,738 --> 00:16:19,137
Boy genius.

243
00:16:20,074 --> 00:16:22,065
You have
to follow me now.

244
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:25,137
- Excuse me?
- You have to follow me now.

245
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,340
Come on.

246
00:16:35,355 --> 00:16:37,721
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

247
00:16:52,193 --> 00:16:55,602
Oh... our honored guest.

248
00:16:57,644 --> 00:16:59,407
How you doing, Ben?
- I'm okay.

249
00:16:59,513 --> 00:17:02,277
- You ever been in this room before?
- Uh, yeah.

250
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,381
Organic Chemistry
in my freshman year.

251
00:17:05,486 --> 00:17:07,977
- How'd you do?
- Well, I got an A.

252
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,152
- Professor Rosa...
- Micky, please.

253
00:17:14,795 --> 00:17:17,161
Is there... a problem
with my paper?

254
00:17:17,264 --> 00:17:20,461
Well, you found a more efficient method
for finding true zero than Isaac Newton

255
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:24,196
and that, my friend, is not so much of
a problem as it is a major ass-kicking.

256
00:17:24,304 --> 00:17:29,298
Although Newton has been dead for over
250 years, so it wasn't exactly a fair fight.

257
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,770
So, is this some kind
of a math club?

258
00:17:33,947 --> 00:17:35,710
Don't be rude, people.

259
00:17:35,816 --> 00:17:38,410
- Kianna.
- Fisher.

260
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:40,111
- Choi.
- Jill.

261
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:47,054
- You ever studied, uh, blackjack?
- Uh, no.

262
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:49,588
No, really? Well,
it's really simple, actually.

263
00:17:49,696 --> 00:17:51,789
You play against the dealer.

264
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:54,057
You're given two cards.

265
00:17:54,168 --> 00:17:56,432
Face cards are worth 10 points.

266
00:17:56,537 --> 00:17:58,596
The closest to 21 wins.

267
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:02,570
If you go over, you lose.
If the dealer goes over, they lose.

268
00:18:04,011 --> 00:18:06,912
It's the most popular
card game in the world.

269
00:18:07,014 --> 00:18:08,242
It's a game with memory.

270
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:11,044
Cards drawn are the past,
ones to come are future.

271
00:18:11,151 --> 00:18:13,881
And the best part,
it's beatable.

272
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:18,351
Are you talking
about counting cards?

273
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:23,054
No. I'm talking about
getting very, very rich.

274
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:28,724
You-you count cards,
right? All of you?

275
00:18:28,836 --> 00:18:30,326
As a team, yes.

276
00:18:30,637 --> 00:18:34,095
- When?
- Weekends. And Christian holidays.

277
00:18:35,475 --> 00:18:37,705
- Where?
- Vegas, baby.

278
00:18:39,413 --> 00:18:41,506
So, why are you
telling me?

279
00:18:42,683 --> 00:18:45,447
Well, let's just say a spot
opened up on our roster.

280
00:18:45,552 --> 00:18:46,576
How?

281
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:49,278
Jimmy got
a job at Google.

282
00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:52,825
- Jimmy got a job at Google?
- Yeah, it's catchy, I know.

283
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,756
Well, if you're making so much money
at this, then why did he take it?

284
00:18:55,863 --> 00:18:58,161
Ben, I said Google,
not Sizzler.

285
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,261
Yeah... This is crazy.

286
00:19:01,368 --> 00:19:04,064
No, Ben.
This is profitable.

287
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,604
Yeah, I-I can't do it.
So, I'm sorry.

288
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,646
- Come on, Ben. It'll be fun.
- Yeah, Ben, it'll be fun.

289
00:19:13,747 --> 00:19:15,305
No, it's not that.
It's...

290
00:19:15,415 --> 00:19:20,352
I just got a promotion at my job,
so, it's kind of not a good time for me.

291
00:19:20,454 --> 00:19:21,921
We pay better.

292
00:19:22,723 --> 00:19:25,351
Look, I can't-I can't just
go to Vegas on weekends.

293
00:19:25,459 --> 00:19:29,088
Why not? MIT's on cruise control for you,
you've already gotten into Harvard Med.

294
00:19:29,196 --> 00:19:31,357
I mean, what do you
have to worry about?

295
00:19:31,465 --> 00:19:35,526
- How did you know that?
- I like to take an interest in my students.

296
00:19:37,104 --> 00:19:41,165
Well, I'm also really involved
in the science competition.

297
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,771
You know, the 2.09 Competition?

298
00:19:44,745 --> 00:19:47,976
Wait, no. I-I'm building
a car that drives by itself.

299
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:50,914
Yeah, well, it's something I've been doing
with my friends for over a year,

300
00:19:51,018 --> 00:19:53,043
so, it's kind of important.

301
00:19:53,153 --> 00:19:56,987
Ben, let the car drive by itself.

302
00:19:59,226 --> 00:20:05,187
Listen, you not only have a gifted mind,
but you're also... composed.

303
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:09,924
You don't give in to your emotions.
You think logically.

304
00:20:11,305 --> 00:20:14,206
Ben, you were born for this.

305
00:20:14,675 --> 00:20:17,405
You'll have more fun than
you've ever had in your entire life.

306
00:20:17,511 --> 00:20:18,910
It's perfect.

307
00:20:20,213 --> 00:20:24,616
Thank you. Um, but I'm...
really not the right guy.

308
00:20:25,686 --> 00:20:27,119
So, I'm sorry.

309
00:20:33,994 --> 00:20:35,120
Ben.

310
00:20:35,996 --> 00:20:38,863
I hope this little conversation
we just had will remain private.

311
00:20:38,966 --> 00:20:40,661
- No, of...
- No.

312
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:42,928
You're one of
my favorite new students,

313
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:46,267
and I'd hate to lose you,
if you know what I mean.

314
00:20:52,846 --> 00:20:55,178
- I'm just not sure it's me.
- It's boring.

315
00:20:55,282 --> 00:20:58,115
It's boxy. It's blue.
How is that not you?

316
00:20:58,752 --> 00:21:00,413
So, how much is this thing
gonna run me?

317
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,719
Oh, well, uh, let's see, the belt's
49.95, minus 15%.

318
00:21:05,826 --> 00:21:08,488
The jacket's 589.99.

319
00:21:08,595 --> 00:21:12,156
The pants are 285.99,
minus 10% for both.

320
00:21:12,265 --> 00:21:16,531
Unfortunately, the shirt's not on sale,
but I can knock off 5% from the 69.99.

321
00:21:16,636 --> 00:21:18,763
The shoes were just
marked down from 155,

322
00:21:18,872 --> 00:21:24,435
so you're looking at
1,042 dollars and 68 cents.

323
00:21:27,647 --> 00:21:29,911
I'm pretty good
with numbers.

324
00:21:31,118 --> 00:21:33,245
- Yeah.
- I guess so.

325
00:21:33,353 --> 00:21:35,651
Yeah, so, let me know when
I can ring that up for you guys.

326
00:21:35,756 --> 00:21:36,890
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thanks.

327
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:37,652
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thanks.

328
00:21:42,963 --> 00:21:43,987
Hey.

329
00:21:46,767 --> 00:21:47,791
Hey.

330
00:21:49,036 --> 00:21:51,937
- Could you help me?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

331
00:21:52,739 --> 00:21:55,071
I-I'm looking for a tie.

332
00:21:55,175 --> 00:21:59,578
Oh, well, we're having
a 15% sale on the ties.

333
00:22:00,814 --> 00:22:04,306
And if you want, I could
probably get you an additional 10%

334
00:22:04,418 --> 00:22:06,443
with my...
my employee discount.

335
00:22:07,587 --> 00:22:10,055
- This one's nice.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

336
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:16,756
This one has actually been treated with
our patented Nano-Tex fabric protection,

337
00:22:16,863 --> 00:22:20,924
you know, to-to repel
liquids and stains.

338
00:22:21,034 --> 00:22:25,562
- Well, that's really functional.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty functional.

339
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:28,207
Face me. Stay still.

340
00:22:30,243 --> 00:22:33,610
Despite being tempted
by the Nano-Tex repellant,

341
00:22:35,282 --> 00:22:39,275
I'm actually...
not here for a tie, Ben.

342
00:22:41,855 --> 00:22:43,482
I came to see you.

343
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:45,985
You did?

344
00:22:48,261 --> 00:22:49,592
Blackjack's a great game.

345
00:22:49,696 --> 00:22:51,323
No, look,
it's easy to learn

346
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:55,231
and there's really not as much strategy
to it as people think.

347
00:22:55,435 --> 00:22:57,426
I grew up on it, actually.

348
00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:00,973
- You grew up on it?
- Yeah.

349
00:23:02,008 --> 00:23:05,307
Every night after dinner,
my father and I would play.

350
00:23:05,545 --> 00:23:09,037
I knew basic strategy
before I was, like, nine years old.

351
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:12,643
If I won, he'd take me out
for ice cream.

352
00:23:12,752 --> 00:23:14,617
And... what if he won?

353
00:23:16,756 --> 00:23:18,246
He'd still take me out
for ice cream.

354
00:23:18,358 --> 00:23:21,691
Oh, yeah. Sure, yeah,
he's your dad.

355
00:23:23,797 --> 00:23:27,062
Ben, you should feel
the thrill

356
00:23:27,567 --> 00:23:31,264
of winning more money
than you can possibly imagine.

357
00:23:37,277 --> 00:23:39,507
I think you should come to Vegas

358
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:44,016
'cause I'm guessing that you could
probably use a break from this place.

359
00:23:49,756 --> 00:23:50,950
I can't.

360
00:23:51,758 --> 00:23:53,157
I'm sorry.

361
00:23:54,261 --> 00:23:55,694
I just can't.

362
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:01,264
Okay. If you change your mind,
you know where we meet.

363
00:24:01,968 --> 00:24:03,128
Yeah.

364
00:24:03,904 --> 00:24:05,769
You're welcome any time.

365
00:24:10,777 --> 00:24:13,644
You know, I think
the best thing about Vegas

366
00:24:14,347 --> 00:24:16,815
is you can become
anyone you want.

367
00:24:46,346 --> 00:24:47,540
- What's the count?
- Plus 9.

368
00:24:47,647 --> 00:24:48,614
- No.
- Plus 11.

369
00:24:48,715 --> 00:24:49,704
No.

370
00:24:50,016 --> 00:24:52,849
- Dude, I lost count 20 cards ago.
- Don't call me "dude."

371
00:24:52,953 --> 00:24:54,352
- Uh, plus 9?
- You're just following Jill.

372
00:24:54,454 --> 00:24:57,617
People, please. We had a total
of 76 cards that came out of the deck.

373
00:24:57,724 --> 00:24:59,851
Twenty-three were high cards
with a value of minus one.

374
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,053
Seventeen were neutral
with no value at all,

375
00:25:02,162 --> 00:25:03,891
and the rest were low cards
with a value of plus one.

376
00:25:03,997 --> 00:25:06,625
How could you lose the count?
- Plus 13.

377
00:25:09,102 --> 00:25:11,662
The count. It's plus 13.

378
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:16,233
Yes.

379
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,002
Pull up a chair.

380
00:25:26,686 --> 00:25:27,778
Stop.

381
00:25:28,555 --> 00:25:31,319
- What is it?
- Plus 12. Eggs.

382
00:25:31,424 --> 00:25:33,392
<i>Twelve eggs in a carton.</i>

383
00:25:33,727 --> 00:25:35,786
- Now what?
- Plus 9.

384
00:25:35,895 --> 00:25:36,953
<i>Cats have nine lives.</i>

385
00:25:37,063 --> 00:25:38,030
Cat.

386
00:25:38,031 --> 00:25:39,196
Plus 16.

387
00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:40,864
<i>Sweet 16.</i>

388
00:25:41,134 --> 00:25:43,227
<i>Every card had a value.</i>

389
00:25:43,336 --> 00:25:47,432
<i>A high card, minus one.
A low card, plus one.</i>

390
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,030
<i>The rest, zero.</i>

391
00:25:49,142 --> 00:25:52,407
Plus 13. Plus 8.
Plus 9. Plus 12.

392
00:25:53,747 --> 00:25:56,215
<i>I was studying
all day, every day.</i>

393
00:25:56,316 --> 00:26:00,776
<i>But it wasn't physics, chemistry
and engineering. I was back to simple math,</i>

394
00:26:00,887 --> 00:26:03,947
<i>used in ways I could
never have imagined.</i>

395
00:26:05,925 --> 00:26:07,722
<i>The team had a system.</i>

396
00:26:08,094 --> 00:26:11,495
<i>And to go unnoticed,
we created a whole new language.</i>

397
00:26:12,766 --> 00:26:15,860
<i>Words were numbers,
and numbers were words.</i>

398
00:26:16,136 --> 00:26:17,603
- Plus 17.
- Magazine.

399
00:26:17,704 --> 00:26:18,728
- Plus 6.
- Gun.

400
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:20,635
- Plus 15.
- Paycheck.

401
00:26:20,974 --> 00:26:22,236
Plus 12.

402
00:26:22,342 --> 00:26:24,435
Uh, is this chemistry review?

403
00:26:29,282 --> 00:26:30,840
- Plus 14.
- Ring.

404
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,076
- Plus 16.
- Sweet.

405
00:26:32,185 --> 00:26:33,550
Use it in a sentence.

406
00:26:33,653 --> 00:26:35,917
Man, that sugar's sweet.

407
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:41,119
<i>Because I knew the count,
I knew which cards were left in the deck.</i>

408
00:26:41,227 --> 00:26:42,751
<i>That's how
I knew what to bet.</i>

409
00:26:42,862 --> 00:26:44,557
You're doing great.

410
00:26:45,932 --> 00:26:50,631
Micky, I... I just wanna let you know
that I'm only doing this for medical school,

411
00:26:50,737 --> 00:26:52,762
which is 300,000.

412
00:26:52,872 --> 00:26:56,535
I mean, if I can get anything
close to that, then I'm done.

413
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:00,075
Well, in the first place, Ben,
it's not "if", it's " when".

414
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,842
And second of all, I get it.
I completely understand.

415
00:27:02,949 --> 00:27:05,577
- You do?
- Yeah. It's a means to an end.

416
00:27:05,685 --> 00:27:08,950
Look, they've got this new computer
software that reads people's faces,

417
00:27:09,055 --> 00:27:12,422
so, who knows how long
this gig's gonna last for any of us?

418
00:27:12,525 --> 00:27:14,254
Well, what if we get caught?

419
00:27:14,361 --> 00:27:17,421
Our system keeps us
under the radar, you'll see.

420
00:27:17,564 --> 00:27:20,192
Anyway, counting cards
isn't illegal.

421
00:27:21,101 --> 00:27:25,561
- So, there's no danger in it at all?
- No, Ben, it's safe. Very safe.

422
00:27:29,476 --> 00:27:31,842
You think you can
beat the system?

423
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:36,613
This is the system,
beating you back.

424
00:27:39,386 --> 00:27:42,514
You wanna count cards,
you do it in Atlantic City.

425
00:27:44,657 --> 00:27:46,921
Get him up.
- Come on, kid.

426
00:27:47,026 --> 00:27:48,584
Count to five.

427
00:27:49,729 --> 00:27:52,391
Count to five!
- What?

428
00:27:52,699 --> 00:27:56,135
Count to five, so I know you don't have
brain damage, you can go home.

429
00:27:56,236 --> 00:27:57,362
Start with one.

430
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,064
One, two, three, four, five.

431
00:28:00,173 --> 00:28:04,371
Good. Now, stop counting.

432
00:28:08,047 --> 00:28:09,275
Let's go.

433
00:28:13,486 --> 00:28:15,420
You're crazy,
everybody knows to split eights.

434
00:28:15,522 --> 00:28:16,580
My grandmother splits eights.

435
00:28:16,689 --> 00:28:19,249
Not against a 10.
It's a sucker play.

436
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,986
Look, you're choosing
to play two hands

437
00:28:21,094 --> 00:28:23,211
against the highest up card
a dealer can have, right?

438
00:28:23,211 --> 00:28:25,755
- Right, and...
- Against a five or a six, it'd be fine.

439
00:28:25,865 --> 00:28:27,924
Against a 10 or an ace,
it's a sucker play.

440
00:28:28,034 --> 00:28:30,662
Yeah, Kianna, save it, all right?
Jill's right. All right?

441
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,068
Choi, why don't you explain
to Ben how we do?

442
00:28:33,173 --> 00:28:34,538
Oh, all right.

443
00:28:34,641 --> 00:28:38,077
So, uh, our team is divided
into two kinds of players,

444
00:28:38,178 --> 00:28:39,895
spotters and big players, right?
- Yeah.

445
00:28:40,013 --> 00:28:43,772
So, if you think that this...
this table is the casino floor, then, um...

446
00:28:44,976 --> 00:28:47,410
salt 'n' pepper shakers
are your spotters. All right.

447
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:50,285
Spotters are just sitting
at the various blackjack tables

448
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:53,723
and they're betting the table minimum.
They never fluctuate their bet.

449
00:28:53,827 --> 00:28:56,819
That's right. Spotters never raise the bet
or play any kind of progressive system.

450
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,660
That's how we stay under the radar,
and that's why we never get caught.

451
00:28:59,766 --> 00:29:02,826
Exactly. Okay, they're just sitting
at the table, betting the table min,

452
00:29:02,936 --> 00:29:05,496
and they're keeping the count
waiting for one of these decks to get hot.

453
00:29:05,605 --> 00:29:07,334
Right. And then when one
of the decks gets hot,

454
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,931
the spotter at that table
signals in the big player.

455
00:29:10,043 --> 00:29:12,477
This... Mustard.
Give me the mustard, honey. Please.

456
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:14,638
Well, I'm always
the mustard, so...

457
00:29:14,747 --> 00:29:18,911
When I get the signal for the hot deck,
I stumble over like some drunk rich kid,

458
00:29:19,018 --> 00:29:22,920
or some zoned out dot-com millionaire,
and I throw down big money.

459
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:25,718
So, the big player bets big
and still keeps the count.

460
00:29:25,825 --> 00:29:28,020
When the deck cools,
he cashes in.

461
00:29:28,127 --> 00:29:29,617
It's not as easy as it sounds.

462
00:29:29,729 --> 00:29:31,162
Oh, yeah, it's not,
you know,

463
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,892
because if Grey Poupon
over here ever loses the count,

464
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,833
it's up to his table's spotter
to give him the signal to get out.

465
00:29:36,936 --> 00:29:39,530
- And you know the signals, right?
- Yeah.

466
00:29:39,772 --> 00:29:40,830
Show us.

467
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,339
Okay, what's this?

468
00:29:42,442 --> 00:29:44,842
- Uh, the deck's hot.
- Right.

469
00:29:44,944 --> 00:29:46,809
Uh, we need to talk.

470
00:29:47,814 --> 00:29:49,475
The deck's cooling.

471
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:52,744
And get out.
Get out now.

472
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:58,550
Good. I think he's gonna be ready
for our little trial run tomorrow.

473
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:01,522
There's a trial run?

474
00:30:02,262 --> 00:30:04,924
- Where?
- You'll find out.

475
00:30:55,949 --> 00:30:57,075
Hey.

476
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:16,564
- You Ben?
- Yeah.

477
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:18,233
Follow me.

478
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:27,774
This way.

479
00:31:35,221 --> 00:31:37,416
Go, go. You go.

480
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:54,402
No more bet.
No more bet.

481
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:01,437
Come on, money.

482
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:03,344
Today, 14.

483
00:32:03,449 --> 00:32:05,212
Whose side are you on?

484
00:32:13,593 --> 00:32:14,753
Sixteen.

485
00:32:14,861 --> 00:32:16,954
Thank you.
Sorry, gentlemen.

486
00:32:19,565 --> 00:32:22,728
So, Henry, did I tell you I read
about this place in a magazine?

487
00:32:31,711 --> 00:32:35,203
You wanna put that money down?
- Yeah. 300.

488
00:32:35,415 --> 00:32:36,575
$300.

489
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:48,019
300.

490
00:32:49,295 --> 00:32:50,762
You bet, sir?

491
00:32:52,632 --> 00:32:53,894
Thanks.

492
00:33:13,486 --> 00:33:15,716
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

493
00:33:15,888 --> 00:33:19,790
" Winner, winner,
chicken dinner." All right.

494
00:33:22,862 --> 00:33:24,124
Nice.

495
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:30,565
Can I get, uh...
Can I another drink, please?

496
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,167
Thank you.

497
00:33:34,941 --> 00:33:36,772
What the hell are you doing?

498
00:33:36,876 --> 00:33:40,004
What are you doing?
I haven't done anything! Get off me!

499
00:33:40,113 --> 00:33:41,740
Get off, I haven't done
anything!

500
00:33:43,816 --> 00:33:45,477
Please.
Please, let go.

501
00:33:45,585 --> 00:33:47,382
- What's the count?
- Please, don't hurt me.

502
00:33:47,487 --> 00:33:49,853
- I said, what's the count?
- Look, I haven't even done anything!

503
00:33:49,956 --> 00:33:51,514
What's the count?

504
00:33:54,026 --> 00:33:55,618
Plus 18.

505
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,458
Oh, you've gotta
be kidding.

506
00:34:02,568 --> 00:34:03,728
Congratulations, Ben.

507
00:34:03,836 --> 00:34:06,066
Sorry, we had to make sure
you'd keep the count under pressure.

508
00:34:06,172 --> 00:34:07,935
Welcome to the team.

509
00:34:09,408 --> 00:34:10,636
We didn't mean it.

510
00:34:10,743 --> 00:34:13,678
It's okay, Campbell,
I cried inside that bag.

511
00:34:22,054 --> 00:34:25,251
Fisher and Jimmy
have always been the big players.

512
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:27,656
I want you to take
Jimmy's place.

513
00:34:28,828 --> 00:34:30,193
I've never done this.

514
00:34:30,296 --> 00:34:31,524
I know that
and I understand.

515
00:34:31,631 --> 00:34:34,759
But I don't trust the girls,
and Choi is, well, Choi.

516
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:37,028
Look, I've been teaching
for more than 14 years,

517
00:34:37,136 --> 00:34:38,933
and I've never had
a student as impressive as you.

518
00:34:39,038 --> 00:34:41,268
Your brain is like
a goddamn Pentium chip.

519
00:34:41,374 --> 00:34:43,899
You're gonna do great.
You know how I know that?

520
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,843
'Cause you remind me
of myself 25 years ago.

521
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,240
You in?

522
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:53,850
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.
- Good. Good.

523
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,951
There's one more thing, Ben,
and this is important.

524
00:35:00,793 --> 00:35:03,557
We're counting cards,
we're not gambling.

525
00:35:03,796 --> 00:35:06,890
We're following a specific set
of rules and playing a system.

526
00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:07,988
Right.

527
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,125
I've seen how crazy
it can get at those tables,

528
00:35:10,236 --> 00:35:13,137
and, sometimes,
people lose control.

529
00:35:13,573 --> 00:35:15,734
They give in
to their emotions.

530
00:35:17,009 --> 00:35:18,442
You will not.

531
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:21,203
You understand?

532
00:35:22,348 --> 00:35:23,372
Yeah.

533
00:35:24,817 --> 00:35:26,284
Get some rest.

534
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:28,944
- Some rest?
- Yeah, we're leaving tomorrow.

535
00:35:29,055 --> 00:35:32,684
Tomorrow? I-I-I have a Quantitative
Literacy paper due Tuesday.

536
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:35,218
- No, you don't.
- I don't?

537
00:35:35,328 --> 00:35:37,193
No, I spoke
to Professor O'Reilly.

538
00:35:37,296 --> 00:35:39,457
I told him you were helping me
with a special assignment,

539
00:35:39,565 --> 00:35:42,193
and he understood,
so, uh, he gave you an A.

540
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:46,894
You see, Ben, amazing things
can happen from the inside.

541
00:35:47,006 --> 00:35:49,600
You'll get a call
about details later.

542
00:35:52,345 --> 00:35:53,778
So, did the girls
go on ahead, huh?

543
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,212
Oh, yeah. They got a lot
more bags to check, you know?

544
00:35:56,315 --> 00:35:57,373
Okay.

545
00:35:57,483 --> 00:36:00,384
Well, wait for us by security 'cause
Ben and I are gonna hit the head.

546
00:36:00,486 --> 00:36:01,578
No, I'm good.

547
00:36:01,687 --> 00:36:04,019
No, I really think you should go.
It's a long flight.

548
00:36:04,123 --> 00:36:06,990
- No, I'm okay.
- We're going to the bathroom.

549
00:36:10,129 --> 00:36:11,858
Honestly, I-I really
don't have to go.

550
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:13,541
- I don't care what you have to do.
- Look, I-I really don't have...

551
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:15,515
Shut up, please,
just shut up.

552
00:36:15,515 --> 00:36:17,865
What are you doin'? Why-why are you
looking over there? Look, I don't...

553
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,063
I don't care.
Shut up. Get in here.

554
00:36:20,172 --> 00:36:22,367
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.

555
00:36:23,576 --> 00:36:25,806
- Pull down your pants.
- What?

556
00:36:26,812 --> 00:36:28,541
Don't ask questions.

557
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,377
- Shove these in your underwear.
- Why?

558
00:36:33,486 --> 00:36:36,819
You want me to do it?
'Cause, I swear to God, I will.

559
00:36:38,591 --> 00:36:41,651
- Why can't we leave it in the bag?
- Because it shows up on the scanner.

560
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:43,888
And we're not about
to have them confiscate 250,000.

561
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:45,725
250,000?

562
00:36:46,165 --> 00:36:49,794
No. Why do I have to do it?
- 'Cause you're the donkey boy.

563
00:36:50,436 --> 00:36:53,098
You really suck at
not asking questions.

564
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,139
What's a donkey boy?

565
00:37:00,746 --> 00:37:03,044
- Step forward, sir.
- Thanks.

566
00:37:04,483 --> 00:37:07,213
- In the basket, please.
- There's a table when you get to the line.

567
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,949
Act casual, think casual,
be casual.

568
00:37:11,057 --> 00:37:13,753
Remove your keys, any metal objects.
Laptops out, please.

569
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:15,190
Thank you.

570
00:37:16,662 --> 00:37:20,758
If you have liquids in a Ziploc bag,
please show them to us now.

571
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:22,925
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

572
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,219
Your boarding pass.

573
00:38:06,245 --> 00:38:07,269
Sir?

574
00:38:19,892 --> 00:38:21,621
You forgot your bag.

575
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,427
Oh. Thanks.

576
00:40:25,017 --> 00:40:26,678
Nice going, Campbell.

577
00:40:26,785 --> 00:40:31,449
Hey, Ben. Basic strategy
says you should, uh, hit that.

578
00:40:42,968 --> 00:40:46,665
Burt, Moishe, Vladimir,

579
00:40:46,772 --> 00:40:49,969
Mona, Miss Sommers,
your new identities are on the bar.

580
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:52,066
So glad you could make it.

581
00:40:52,311 --> 00:40:54,176
Vladimir Stupnitsky?

582
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,578
Yeah. Your dad's a diplomat
with the Russian consulate.

583
00:40:56,682 --> 00:40:57,842
You live in Washington, D.C.

584
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:01,716
Your hobbies are backgammon, chess
and long walks on the beach.

585
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,084
- I-I don't like my name.
- Why not?

586
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:07,284
" Sierra Sommers."
Do I look like a Sierra?

587
00:41:07,393 --> 00:41:09,588
Well, you have a lot of
clever outfits. You'll figure it out.

588
00:41:09,695 --> 00:41:12,858
Just pretend you don't speak English.
Then you don't have to change your hair.

589
00:41:12,965 --> 00:41:16,162
You know, I-I thought this was legal.
Why do we have to use fake names?

590
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:18,498
Well, it is. We not only use fake names,
we use disguises.

591
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:21,300
It's for the benefit of the dealers
to make sure you're old enough to gamble

592
00:41:21,407 --> 00:41:23,671
and it allows everyone to be
different people in different casinos.

593
00:41:23,776 --> 00:41:27,803
Hey! You steal the Bible,
you go to hell. That's the way it works.

594
00:41:28,247 --> 00:41:29,612
Like I'm not going already.

595
00:41:29,715 --> 00:41:30,807
Yeah. All right.
Now, listen.

596
00:41:30,916 --> 00:41:33,851
Ben, this is for you. All the casinos
have cameras in the ceiling.

597
00:41:33,953 --> 00:41:35,318
They're called "eyes in the sky".

598
00:41:35,421 --> 00:41:38,356
For their benefit, order a tonic water
and lime and act a little drunk,

599
00:41:38,457 --> 00:41:40,948
and, at all times,
you don't know each other.

600
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:45,360
Let me say that one more time,
you do not know each other ever.

601
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:47,691
Oh, and what's our motto?

602
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,734
- Don't get caught counting.
- Don't get caught counting.

603
00:41:49,835 --> 00:41:51,530
Thank you very much.

604
00:41:52,605 --> 00:41:54,163
How come
you don't play?

605
00:41:54,273 --> 00:41:57,470
Oh, I did. I played for a long time
and I was the best. But I'm retired now.

606
00:41:57,576 --> 00:42:00,477
Take my advice, Ben, it's always best
to go out when you're on top.

607
00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:02,171
Welcome to Vegas.

608
00:42:12,424 --> 00:42:13,550
No more bets.

609
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:15,490
All right, here we go.
Big money, now. Big money.

610
00:42:15,594 --> 00:42:18,654
Let me tell you about blackjack, honey.
You ever hear of basic strategy?

611
00:42:18,764 --> 00:42:21,494
Oh, see, now that sounds
really complicated.

612
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,761
I'm Sierra Sommers from Charleston.
- Pleasure.

613
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:26,531
Here to double
my family's inheritance.

614
00:42:28,307 --> 00:42:29,797
I don't know.

615
00:42:49,561 --> 00:42:51,028
10,000.

616
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,931
Changing 10,000.

617
00:42:54,033 --> 00:42:55,898
Sweet. Too sweet.

618
00:43:16,588 --> 00:43:19,182
<i>Eight. The count's
still plus 16.</i>

619
00:43:20,793 --> 00:43:22,761
<i>Ten. That's minus one.</i>

620
00:43:23,095 --> 00:43:24,722
<i>Count's plus 15.</i>

621
00:43:26,131 --> 00:43:28,725
<i>Eight. Still plus 15.</i>

622
00:43:30,302 --> 00:43:32,270
<i>Nine. Plus 15.</i>

623
00:43:34,273 --> 00:43:36,901
<i>Five. The count's 16.</i>

624
00:43:38,544 --> 00:43:40,307
<i>Eights. Split eights.</i>

625
00:43:40,612 --> 00:43:41,636
Can I split those?

626
00:43:41,747 --> 00:43:44,739
- Sir, please don't touch the cards.
- I'm sorry.

627
00:43:51,957 --> 00:43:54,482
<i>Jack. Count's plus 15.</i>

628
00:43:57,863 --> 00:44:00,229
<i>Ten. Plus 14.</i>

629
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:09,305
<i>King. Nine. Plus 13.</i>

630
00:44:16,315 --> 00:44:17,805
<i>Jack. Plus 12.</i>

631
00:44:18,851 --> 00:44:20,876
<i>Nine. Still plus 12.</i>

632
00:44:21,353 --> 00:44:22,718
<i>Blackjack.</i>

633
00:45:08,534 --> 00:45:09,933
Monkey! Monkey!

634
00:45:10,035 --> 00:45:11,935
- So, what's a monkey?
- Face card.

635
00:45:12,037 --> 00:45:15,438
All right, face card.
Come on, monkey. Okay, monkey.

636
00:45:18,977 --> 00:45:20,137
Monkey!

637
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:21,911
Monkey! Come on,
give us a monkey!

638
00:45:22,014 --> 00:45:25,177
Monkey! Come on, monkey,
monkey, monkey! Monkey.

639
00:45:25,284 --> 00:45:26,774
Monkey! Monkey!

640
00:45:30,088 --> 00:45:31,953
All right, all right.

641
00:45:35,494 --> 00:45:37,689
Oh, God.

642
00:45:38,831 --> 00:45:40,355
I need to quit.

643
00:45:44,588 --> 00:45:47,330
Uh, could I color up,
please?

644
00:46:30,249 --> 00:46:31,614
Nice undies.

645
00:46:38,156 --> 00:46:40,181
- What's this?
- It's last night's take.

646
00:46:40,292 --> 00:46:42,123
We split it fiveways.

647
00:46:47,366 --> 00:46:49,061
So, what do you think?

648
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:50,794
Yeah, it was fun.

649
00:46:51,236 --> 00:46:52,703
- You were good.
- Really?

650
00:46:52,804 --> 00:46:56,240
Yeah. Came in quick off the count.
You acted the part.

651
00:46:56,341 --> 00:47:00,300
You weren't afraid to play big, and
you got out when you were supposed to.

652
00:47:02,114 --> 00:47:04,605
And you made
more money than Fisher.

653
00:47:04,883 --> 00:47:07,443
Yeah, I was... I was
pretty nervous, actually.

654
00:47:08,086 --> 00:47:11,522
You know, but after a while,
it felt kind of... easy.

655
00:47:13,325 --> 00:47:14,849
Not for everyone.

656
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,087
Yeah, it's just simple math.

657
00:47:17,663 --> 00:47:20,564
Good. We can do
some serious damage with you.

658
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:28,303
Uhm... Here's the thing...
here's the thing I told Micky.

659
00:47:28,707 --> 00:47:32,905
You know, I'm only really doing this
just to pay for medical school.

660
00:47:33,011 --> 00:47:35,673
You know, 300,000 dollars
and then I'm out.

661
00:47:38,216 --> 00:47:40,343
That's what they all say.

662
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,748
No, really, I mean, I'm just
doing this to pay for Harvard.

663
00:47:44,856 --> 00:47:47,324
It's... just a means
to an end for me.

664
00:47:49,194 --> 00:47:50,661
I believe you.

665
00:47:51,129 --> 00:47:52,221
Good.

666
00:48:02,441 --> 00:48:05,501
<i>- Hello?
- We have a team meeting in five minutes.</i>

667
00:48:07,312 --> 00:48:08,301
Team meeting.

668
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,008
Hello?

669
00:48:10,115 --> 00:48:11,377
- Hey.
- Hey.

670
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:13,217
Where's everybody else?

671
00:48:13,318 --> 00:48:16,082
I don't know.
Fisher was right behind us.

672
00:48:20,058 --> 00:48:22,185
Oh, Fisher,
you didn't sleep.

673
00:48:22,561 --> 00:48:27,021
- I did. With Ida.
- Ida?

674
00:48:27,532 --> 00:48:31,161
She's a dancer.
I pulled her out of Sapphire.

675
00:48:31,703 --> 00:48:36,140
- And Ida's her dancer name?
- Yeah. After her grandmother.

676
00:48:37,175 --> 00:48:38,642
Where's Kianna?

677
00:48:38,944 --> 00:48:40,104
Slots.

678
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:45,578
- Choi, where the hell you been?
- Unattended maid cart, ninth floor.

679
00:48:46,385 --> 00:48:48,615
I've been busy this morning.

680
00:48:52,024 --> 00:48:53,423
All right, guys,
let's get something clear.

681
00:48:53,525 --> 00:48:55,755
This is not summer camp
and I'm not your counselor.

682
00:48:55,861 --> 00:48:58,261
This is real, world-class
moneymaking business.

683
00:48:58,363 --> 00:49:00,354
Kianna,
slots are for losers.

684
00:49:00,465 --> 00:49:02,626
Fisher, peelers are stealers.

685
00:49:02,934 --> 00:49:03,992
Choi?
- Hmm?

686
00:49:04,302 --> 00:49:08,466
You made five grand last night,
so would you stop stealing nine-cent pens

687
00:49:08,573 --> 00:49:12,373
and everything you can get your hands on
from the maid's cart? It's embarrassing.

688
00:49:12,477 --> 00:49:16,538
But, Fisher, what the hell
were you up to last night?

689
00:49:16,915 --> 00:49:17,939
What?

690
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:21,042
Three separate occasions, the spotters
let you know that the deck was cooling,

691
00:49:21,153 --> 00:49:22,347
but you kept on anyway.

692
00:49:22,454 --> 00:49:24,046
You either lost the count
or you lost your head.

693
00:49:24,156 --> 00:49:26,090
In either case, I don't wanna
see it happen again.

694
00:49:26,191 --> 00:49:28,056
Jill, nice disguise last night.

695
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,824
And Ben, good work. You came out
of that chute like a pro. Keep it up.

696
00:49:33,899 --> 00:49:34,888
Beginner's luck.

697
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,992
Hey, Fisher. Win like a man,
lose like a man.

698
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:40,629
Micky, I didn't play
into a cold deck three times.

699
00:49:40,739 --> 00:49:42,070
You know what's worse
than a loser?

700
00:49:42,174 --> 00:49:45,405
Someone who won't admit
he played it wrong.

701
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:47,375
Take it up with Ida.

702
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,808
Who's Ida?

703
00:49:50,749 --> 00:49:52,307
Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.

704
00:49:52,417 --> 00:49:54,408
- Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.

705
00:50:21,346 --> 00:50:23,337
There goes that paycheck.

706
00:50:31,289 --> 00:50:34,190
- Money plays.
- Money plays, up to the limit.

707
00:50:37,429 --> 00:50:39,363
How's she...
how's she doing?

708
00:50:39,765 --> 00:50:41,062
Oh, that doesn't matter, man.

709
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:44,067
The way I see it, yesterday's
history, tomorrow's a mystery.

710
00:50:44,169 --> 00:50:46,967
It's all what you do
in the moment, baby.

711
00:50:59,117 --> 00:51:01,176
Just lost another property.

712
00:51:02,254 --> 00:51:05,655
- Who is it this time, Caesar's or the Mirage?
- Caesar's.

713
00:51:07,259 --> 00:51:09,318
That was a 14-year account.

714
00:51:09,661 --> 00:51:13,597
- They opted to go with the new software.
- I know, Terry, I know.

715
00:51:14,232 --> 00:51:19,192
Hey, Cole. We got absolutely murdered in
pits four and five the last couple of nights.

716
00:51:19,304 --> 00:51:22,102
Okay, Clark, I'll, uh,
take a look at the tape.

717
00:51:22,307 --> 00:51:25,743
By the way, you, uh,
wanna lose the cigarette?

718
00:51:27,212 --> 00:51:30,204
There's no smoking in here,
you know that.

719
00:51:36,354 --> 00:51:37,878
I appreciate it.

720
00:51:44,563 --> 00:51:46,531
End of an era,
my friend.

721
00:51:55,774 --> 00:51:57,605
Ben. Time for school.

722
00:52:01,446 --> 00:52:03,607
I seem to keep
waking up to you.

723
00:52:03,715 --> 00:52:05,376
Don't get used to it.

724
00:52:24,369 --> 00:52:26,860
I'm glad you came over
this morning.

725
00:52:28,006 --> 00:52:30,975
I have something I wanna give you.
- Oh, yeah?

726
00:52:33,445 --> 00:52:35,470
I want you to have this.

727
00:52:36,181 --> 00:52:37,443
What's this?

728
00:52:43,054 --> 00:52:44,885
That's a lot of money.

729
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:49,019
I've been saving for a long time.
It's for medical school.

730
00:52:49,127 --> 00:52:53,461
I know it won't pay
the whole way, but it should help.

731
00:52:54,766 --> 00:52:57,633
Ma, I can't take this.

732
00:52:58,136 --> 00:53:00,263
This is your money.
You worked hard for this.

733
00:53:00,372 --> 00:53:05,173
For precisely this reason. I wanna help
pay for med school, dr. Campbell.

734
00:53:11,349 --> 00:53:13,214
Well, you know what?
You don't have to.

735
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:16,754
'Cause, uh, I got
the Robinson scholarship.

736
00:53:17,522 --> 00:53:20,047
Yep, they're gonna pay
the whole way.

737
00:53:20,592 --> 00:53:24,392
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Well, because... I wanted it to be a surprise.

738
00:53:24,496 --> 00:53:26,691
And, actually,
I just found out today.

739
00:53:26,798 --> 00:53:30,189
- I can't believe it! Oh, my God!
- I know.

740
00:53:30,189 --> 00:53:33,533
This is amazing.
I am so proud of you.

741
00:53:38,343 --> 00:53:41,540
I knew the hard work would pay off.
- Yeah, I know.

742
00:53:41,646 --> 00:53:46,140
So, listen, you... you keep this,
all right? That's... yours.

743
00:54:25,223 --> 00:54:26,884
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

744
00:54:27,993 --> 00:54:31,861
I'm... just... jumping up
and down on my bed.

745
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,964
What? You never did that
when you were a kid?

746
00:54:38,069 --> 00:54:40,560
- No. Not really, never.
- No.

747
00:54:41,573 --> 00:54:42,699
Right.

748
00:54:45,977 --> 00:54:47,137
All right.

749
00:54:47,245 --> 00:54:49,679
So, where were you this weekend?
I tried calling you, like, 15 times.

750
00:54:49,781 --> 00:54:53,444
Oh, yeah? I-I-I ended up
having to go to, uh, New Hampshire

751
00:54:53,551 --> 00:54:55,951
to help my cousin move.

752
00:54:56,054 --> 00:54:57,988
You didn't bring
your cell phone?

753
00:54:58,089 --> 00:55:00,819
Your cell? Your phone?
You didn't bring that?

754
00:55:00,925 --> 00:55:06,227
No, I, uh, I-I forgot it. I, uh, ended up
leaving it here. So, you know...

755
00:55:06,331 --> 00:55:08,697
Yeah, well, you missed
a hell of a dorm party on Saturday.

756
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,333
Oh, yeah?

757
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:12,365
We, uh, we almost
had a girl there.

758
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,902
- Republik?
- Yes.

759
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:19,434
Let's do it!

760
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,344
She is an eight.

761
00:55:30,688 --> 00:55:35,125
- No way. She's a 7.649.
- I was rounding up.

762
00:55:35,226 --> 00:55:38,195
Hey, I thought we agreed
we weren't gonna round up anymore.

763
00:55:38,296 --> 00:55:39,820
That's right.

764
00:55:40,698 --> 00:55:44,634
But, if we win the 2.09,
I'm asking her out.

765
00:55:52,877 --> 00:55:55,710
Wait. Ben? Ben, you only
owe eight bucks.

766
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,120
Hey. I... C-can I
get you a beer?

767
00:56:07,025 --> 00:56:09,823
- Sure.
- Yeah? Okay.

768
00:56:13,216 --> 00:56:16,590
Uh, excuse me.
Can I get two Bud Lights?

769
00:56:17,035 --> 00:56:18,127
Hey.

770
00:56:22,974 --> 00:56:24,839
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

771
00:56:24,943 --> 00:56:26,433
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

772
00:56:27,312 --> 00:56:28,609
Thank you.

773
00:56:34,786 --> 00:56:37,152
Are those your friends
over there?

774
00:56:40,725 --> 00:56:44,889
No. No, I've never seen them
before in my life.

775
00:56:46,364 --> 00:56:49,060
Could you just excuse me
for... one second?

776
00:56:51,369 --> 00:56:54,429
Guys, I'm serious.
What are you doing? You're staring.

777
00:56:54,539 --> 00:56:55,597
Yeah, we know.

778
00:56:55,707 --> 00:56:56,731
Yeah, well, can you not?

779
00:56:56,841 --> 00:56:58,604
I think it's gonna freak
her out a bit, don't you think?

780
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:02,339
Yeah, I, uh, I got a feeling we're a little
more freaked out than she is right now.

781
00:57:02,447 --> 00:57:04,108
So, how do you know her?

782
00:57:04,215 --> 00:57:07,707
Did you, like, take some self-help
seminar or something?

783
00:57:08,786 --> 00:57:09,844
What?

784
00:57:10,355 --> 00:57:13,916
- Jedi mind trick, huh?
- Jedi mind trick. Like that Luke.

785
00:57:14,192 --> 00:57:17,184
- You will drink beer.
- Right. Right, right.

786
00:57:17,295 --> 00:57:20,389
There is a fortune on the table now,
and it's all up to my dad.

787
00:57:20,498 --> 00:57:22,090
It's getting ridiculous.

788
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,761
He actually needs to stop the table play,
track down my uncle and take a loan.

789
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:27,337
- No, are you serious?
- Yeah.

790
00:57:27,438 --> 00:57:29,429
They let him,
and he does.

791
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:33,075
He ends up with, like,
two 19s and two 20s.

792
00:57:33,745 --> 00:57:36,236
The dealer turns over a 17.

793
00:57:36,347 --> 00:57:38,076
It's soft. He needs
to take another card.

794
00:57:38,183 --> 00:57:40,549
No. Don't say a four.
Is it a four?

795
00:57:40,652 --> 00:57:43,450
- It's a four, yeah.
- It's a four. Ah, my God.

796
00:57:44,789 --> 00:57:47,087
Not a great Christmas
that year.

797
00:57:49,627 --> 00:57:53,085
So, what does he think about
what you do? D-d-does he know?

798
00:57:53,665 --> 00:57:55,826
Oh, no, he's long gone, Ben.

799
00:57:58,403 --> 00:58:00,200
My dad's gone, too.

800
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:17,451
So, uh, you know, when you came
into the store to ask me to join the team,

801
00:58:18,289 --> 00:58:19,950
was that because...

802
00:58:20,358 --> 00:58:21,552
What?

803
00:58:21,893 --> 00:58:25,226
Well, you know, was it
because... Micky asked you to?

804
00:58:28,366 --> 00:58:31,494
Look, we've had
three classes together.

805
00:58:32,503 --> 00:58:35,472
You gave that presentation
on combinatorial algorithms

806
00:58:35,573 --> 00:58:37,404
that nobody understood.

807
00:58:38,543 --> 00:58:42,741
You're the smartest person in every
single one of those classes, Ben.

808
00:58:42,847 --> 00:58:47,011
That is why you're on the team.
And that's why I came into the store.

809
00:58:48,219 --> 00:58:50,153
Oh, wait, no, no,
not so much...

810
00:58:50,255 --> 00:58:53,122
- Oh, God. I'm so, so sorry.
- No. It's fine.

811
00:58:53,224 --> 00:58:55,658
It's not a problem.
- I-I don't know why I just did that.

812
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,988
- Don't apologize.
- Are-are you sure?

813
00:58:57,095 --> 00:58:59,655
Yes. Um, shit,
this is-this my stop.

814
00:58:59,764 --> 00:59:02,164
- You're getting off here?
- Yeah, I've gotta get off.

815
00:59:02,267 --> 00:59:04,963
But, really,
don't worry about it.

816
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:08,833
I... It's... I don't know, it's just
'cause we've been drinking, and...

817
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:11,431
It's just we're on a team,
we work together.

818
00:59:11,542 --> 00:59:13,976
- I-I get it.
- Just don't feel bad about this.

819
00:59:14,078 --> 00:59:14,677
- Okay.
- Okay.

820
00:59:14,677 --> 00:59:16,473
Sure. Bye.

821
00:59:36,734 --> 00:59:40,465
<i>My world was flashing by
at a million miles a minute.</i>

822
00:59:41,806 --> 00:59:44,775
<i>I had saved
over 100,000 dollars.</i>

823
00:59:45,943 --> 00:59:48,002
<i>Only 200,000 to go.</i>

824
00:59:49,213 --> 00:59:53,149
<i>But there was still one thing
I couldn't get off my mind.</i>

825
01:00:03,561 --> 01:00:05,256
<i>The moment we left campus,</i>

826
01:00:05,363 --> 01:00:07,627
<i>the concept of
vectors and formulas</i>

827
01:00:07,732 --> 01:00:10,428
<i>were replaced with
counting, shuffle tracking</i>

828
01:00:10,535 --> 01:00:13,698
<i>knowing when to hit and
knowing when to color out.</i>

829
01:00:13,938 --> 01:00:16,532
<i>I was becoming
a pro on all levels.</i>

830
01:00:17,008 --> 01:00:18,805
<i>I made more money
in one trip to Vegas</i>

831
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:24,314
<i>than I would have in 5 years, 9 months,
12 days and 6 hours at J. Press Menswear.</i>

832
01:00:26,684 --> 01:00:29,152
<i>In Boston, I was
just Ben Campbell.</i>

833
01:00:30,188 --> 01:00:33,919
<i>But in Vegas, I could be
anyone I wanted.</i>

834
01:00:34,025 --> 01:00:36,323
You know what I'm gonna do?
You know what I'm gonna do?

835
01:00:36,427 --> 01:00:39,692
I'm gonna throw a half-mill down
on the one hand. Come on. Hit me!

836
01:00:39,797 --> 01:00:43,028
<i>One night, I'd be the high-rolling heir
to a pharmaceutical fortune.</i>

837
01:00:43,134 --> 01:00:46,262
Leon, could you make sure
there's some champagne,

838
01:00:46,671 --> 01:00:50,334
maybe some strawberries
waiting in there for me.

839
01:00:50,842 --> 01:00:52,173
I may not be alone.

840
01:00:52,276 --> 01:00:55,905
<i>The next, I'd be the hottest video game
designer on the West Coast.</i>

841
01:00:56,514 --> 01:00:57,913
There it is.

842
01:00:58,015 --> 01:01:01,507
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner!

843
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:07,751
No, please, keep going.
This video's priceless.

844
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:10,887
<i>I'm not gonna lie.</i>

845
01:01:11,596 --> 01:01:16,090
<i>It did get, well...
a little confusing sometimes.</i>

846
01:01:17,034 --> 01:01:18,626
<i>Operator, how can I help you?</i>

847
01:01:18,736 --> 01:01:21,034
Ah, yeah, um, room service.

848
01:01:21,139 --> 01:01:23,573
<i>Excuse me? Honey,
we don't do room service.</i>

849
01:01:23,674 --> 01:01:25,335
What do you mean,
you don't do room service?

850
01:01:25,443 --> 01:01:27,809
<i>I mean, we don't
do room service.</i>

851
01:01:39,857 --> 01:01:42,519
<i>In Boston, we had a secret.</i>

852
01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:51,393
<i>In Vegas, we had a life.</i>

853
01:01:59,877 --> 01:02:04,314
<i>Micky said I was gonna have more fun
than I could possibly imagine.</i>

854
01:02:05,483 --> 01:02:07,041
<i>And he was right.</i>

855
01:02:11,022 --> 01:02:13,081
- Hey, Jamie. There you go.
- Nice.

856
01:02:13,191 --> 01:02:14,886
<i>It was too good to be true.</i>

857
01:02:14,992 --> 01:02:19,019
Ah, there you go. All right, my night
just got better. Thank you, Joe.

858
01:02:20,097 --> 01:02:22,964
<i>And it felt like it was
never going to end.</i>

859
01:02:33,344 --> 01:02:36,438
Clark? I got something
over here.

860
01:02:37,148 --> 01:02:38,843
Take a look at this.

861
01:02:41,352 --> 01:02:43,820
That guy? He's a kid.

862
01:02:43,921 --> 01:02:47,652
He was on the tape from last week.
Got a big roll and he's crushing your table.

863
01:02:47,758 --> 01:02:50,124
Plus, he ordered
a tonic and lime.

864
01:02:50,228 --> 01:02:52,924
Tonic and lime.
What does that mean?

865
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:55,260
It means he wants you
to think he's drinking.

866
01:02:55,366 --> 01:02:58,665
Okay. So, is he counting
or is he just getting lucky?

867
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:00,804
He's not running
a progressive system.

868
01:03:00,905 --> 01:03:04,102
He doubled on 10 when the deck was heavy,
but he didn't on 11 when it got lighter.

869
01:03:04,208 --> 01:03:06,836
- How can you tell if it's heavy or light?
- I'm counting.

870
01:03:06,944 --> 01:03:08,104
You...

871
01:03:11,449 --> 01:03:13,246
Tell me something, Cole,
if you can count that well,

872
01:03:13,351 --> 01:03:15,080
why are you still
consulting for us?

873
01:03:15,186 --> 01:03:16,653
I've been asking myself
the same thing.

874
01:03:16,754 --> 01:03:20,190
Let's just say I like being
on your side of the hustle.

875
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:23,617
Bring up a frame of that
for me on the printer.

876
01:03:27,131 --> 01:03:29,622
So, Terry, I heard you guys
are losing a lot of work

877
01:03:29,734 --> 01:03:32,760
to that biometric
facial recognition software.

878
01:03:34,338 --> 01:03:37,933
Just gives us a little bit
more time to focus on you guys.

879
01:03:40,478 --> 01:03:43,208
- That's impressive software.
- They do.

880
01:03:43,881 --> 01:03:45,212
Here he is.

881
01:03:47,552 --> 01:03:50,612
I still think there're
bigger fish to fry out there.

882
01:03:50,721 --> 01:03:52,052
So do I.

883
01:03:59,931 --> 01:04:01,523
Hey, Fisher.

884
01:04:01,632 --> 01:04:03,691
Ah, he's mad at me
and jealous of you.

885
01:04:03,801 --> 01:04:06,292
But don't worry. Greatness evokes
that reaction sometimes.

886
01:04:06,404 --> 01:04:09,339
Don't worry about it. I gotta go.
- All right.

887
01:04:18,215 --> 01:04:20,183
- Hey.
- What's going on?

888
01:04:21,419 --> 01:04:25,048
Ah, he... just didn't like the subject
I chose for my final paper.

889
01:04:25,156 --> 01:04:26,783
- That's bullshit, Ben.
- What?

890
01:04:26,891 --> 01:04:28,825
I know when you're lying,
I'm your best friend.

891
01:04:28,926 --> 01:04:30,951
At least, I thought I was.

892
01:04:32,096 --> 01:04:33,688
Are you on drugs, Ben?

893
01:04:33,798 --> 01:04:35,732
Because there's a group that meets
at Simpson Hall on Saturdays.

894
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:37,767
No, no. Cam, I'm not
on drugs, okay?

895
01:04:37,868 --> 01:04:40,632
I'll go to the meeting
if you need me to.

896
01:04:41,238 --> 01:04:43,968
Why didn't you tell me
you quit J. Press?

897
01:04:45,443 --> 01:04:46,876
I don't know.

898
01:04:47,345 --> 01:04:49,575
- Is it Jill Taylor?
- No.

899
01:04:51,749 --> 01:04:53,410
What about Harvard?

900
01:04:54,885 --> 01:04:57,547
It'll find a way of
working itself out.

901
01:04:58,255 --> 01:05:00,849
Look, I gotta go.
I'll see you.

902
01:05:13,137 --> 01:05:17,233
<i>I think the worst part of it
was... not being able to tell anyone.</i>

903
01:05:21,412 --> 01:05:25,542
<i>But for the first time in my life,
the world made itself easy for me.</i>

904
01:05:27,184 --> 01:05:28,310
Here you go, sir.

905
01:05:28,419 --> 01:05:29,977
<i>And I liked it.</i>

906
01:05:30,688 --> 01:05:32,155
That's for you.

907
01:05:34,425 --> 01:05:38,759
We just made two hundred
and ten... thousand dollars.

908
01:05:38,863 --> 01:05:39,921
Yes.

909
01:05:40,031 --> 01:05:42,522
Now, Ben,
this is how we play!

910
01:05:45,169 --> 01:05:47,603
<i>And play we did.</i>

911
01:05:51,842 --> 01:05:53,935
<i>Nothing cost too much.</i>

912
01:05:54,045 --> 01:05:56,570
<i>Nothing was out of reach.</i>

913
01:06:02,219 --> 01:06:05,052
<i>I guess you could say
the casino host of fate</i>

914
01:06:05,156 --> 01:06:07,750
<i>gave Ben Campbell
a major upgrade.</i>

915
01:06:10,728 --> 01:06:13,595
<i>Dorm rooms turned into
high-roller suites.</i>

916
01:06:15,266 --> 01:06:17,791
<i>Bicycles became
stretch limos.</i>

917
01:06:21,439 --> 01:06:22,872
No, no!

918
01:06:26,177 --> 01:06:30,637
<i>And college bars that were always filled
with frat dudes were upgraded to,</i>

919
01:06:31,482 --> 01:06:35,384
<i>well, something
more... interesting.</i>

920
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:33,006
- Hey, baby. Where you in from?
- Uh, I-I'm from Boston.

921
01:07:34,278 --> 01:07:38,180
- On a convention?
- No, uh, business, actually.

922
01:07:40,384 --> 01:07:42,750
What line of work
you in, mister?

923
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:45,250
I-I count things.

924
01:07:47,424 --> 01:07:49,016
My name's Sierra.

925
01:07:49,593 --> 01:07:54,826
Hi, Sierra. I'm, uh,
Salvador Sanchez.

926
01:07:56,834 --> 01:07:59,598
Would you like
a private dance, Salvador?

927
01:08:01,205 --> 01:08:05,107
Well, that all depends on
how much it's gonna run me, Sierra.

928
01:08:07,611 --> 01:08:10,239
20 a song, 30-song minimum.

929
01:08:12,116 --> 01:08:13,708
Sounds expensive.

930
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:37,230
- Good evening, Mr. Klein.
- Hey, Frank. It's good to see you.

931
01:08:37,341 --> 01:08:39,832
Jeffrey, you're taking my money.

932
01:08:40,945 --> 01:08:42,913
You are so lucky
you're cute.

933
01:08:43,013 --> 01:08:45,709
'Cause if you weren't cute,
I'd leave. You know that?

934
01:08:45,816 --> 01:08:49,377
Jeffrey. My brother
from another mother.

935
01:08:49,954 --> 01:08:51,046
How you doing? You good?

936
01:08:51,155 --> 01:08:54,352
I'm good, I'm good, Mr. K. What,
are you back in town for business?

937
01:08:54,458 --> 01:08:59,589
- It's all business in this town, right?
- Well, with your money, I'm sure it always is.

938
01:09:00,497 --> 01:09:02,431
Oh, damn,
I forgot my ring.

939
01:09:02,533 --> 01:09:04,433
Oh, please.

940
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:14,473
Oh, I don't wanna bet that.
That's for... that's for keep.

941
01:09:14,812 --> 01:09:16,507
100,000 going out.

942
01:09:18,883 --> 01:09:20,544
Thank you, Jeffrey.

943
01:09:27,758 --> 01:09:28,773
- Cole.
- Yeah.

944
01:09:28,773 --> 01:09:29,807
 Your boy's back.

945
01:09:33,831 --> 01:09:35,389
That's him, right?
- There he is.

946
01:09:35,499 --> 01:09:38,525
And he brought a whole lot
more money with him.

947
01:09:45,676 --> 01:09:48,236
That is a hell of a suit,
by the way.

948
01:10:03,827 --> 01:10:08,059
That is some aftershave he has going on.
- Sir, could you not? Please.

949
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:16,437
This girl's only betting the table minimum.
Why's she keep looking at him?

950
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:21,239
Terry, rewind the tape. I wanna see
if she, uh, signals him to come to the table.

951
01:10:22,646 --> 01:10:26,241
We don't use "tape" anymore,
old school. It's digital now.

952
01:10:28,652 --> 01:10:30,813
Never mind.
Terry, rewind it.

953
01:10:33,691 --> 01:10:35,215
Okay, okay.

954
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,621
She's playing
the table minimum.

955
01:10:37,728 --> 01:10:39,889
Now, in a second,
she's gonna do something.

956
01:10:39,997 --> 01:10:43,865
She's gonna, uh, raise her hand,
scratch her head... There it is.

957
01:10:45,035 --> 01:10:47,970
That's the signal. See?
She gave him the signal.

958
01:10:48,072 --> 01:10:51,405
He comes to the table. I'm telling you,
they're working together.

959
01:10:51,508 --> 01:10:52,566
Nice.

960
01:10:54,244 --> 01:10:56,804
Show me a computer
that can do that.

961
01:11:01,652 --> 01:11:03,279
You look familiar.

962
01:11:04,588 --> 01:11:06,351
I know you, don't I?

963
01:11:07,958 --> 01:11:09,789
- I don't think so.
- No?

964
01:11:10,327 --> 01:11:14,593
Oh, sure, you look exactly like
that guy in Rain Man.

965
01:11:16,934 --> 01:11:19,767
Oh, yeah? Well, people say
I look like Tom Cruise all the time.

966
01:11:19,870 --> 01:11:21,565
Oh, yeah? No, I'd, uh...

967
01:11:22,673 --> 01:11:26,336
The other one, the... What's his...
Uhhh... The retard.

968
01:11:27,344 --> 01:11:32,577
I just love that scene in Vegas
when the retard wins at blackjack.

969
01:11:33,517 --> 01:11:35,451
You look just like that.

970
01:11:39,323 --> 01:11:46,195
What I could never understand, though,
is how someone so retarded,

971
01:11:47,097 --> 01:11:48,792
could win so much.

972
01:11:51,168 --> 01:11:54,660
Hey, Jeffrey, his brother
from another mother,

973
01:11:54,772 --> 01:11:56,535
how did that retard
win so much?

974
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,575
- You know what, sir? I think that maybe...
- Okay, get your hands off me.

975
01:11:59,676 --> 01:12:01,871
Oh, I didn't mean it.

976
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:39,277
His luck'll run out eventually.
It always does.

977
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:51,890
- Hey, Ben...
- No, Ben, stop it!

978
01:12:51,995 --> 01:12:53,860
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- Hey, come on! Ben!

979
01:12:53,964 --> 01:12:57,422
Oh, you think that's funny?
You think that was funny? Shut up!

980
01:12:57,534 --> 01:12:58,899
I understand, Ben.
We don't need any more...

981
01:12:59,002 --> 01:13:00,833
This is not the time. Okay?

982
01:13:00,938 --> 01:13:03,240
I wanna thank you for
confirming my choice in Ben.

983
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:04,776
- Sure.
- Now, go home.

984
01:13:11,582 --> 01:13:13,573
- What?
- You're off the team.

985
01:13:13,684 --> 01:13:14,742
No.

986
01:13:15,752 --> 01:13:19,119
- I was-I was drunk, I was...
- I don't care what you were.

987
01:13:20,357 --> 01:13:21,654
I'm not leaving.

988
01:13:21,758 --> 01:13:24,283
Yes, you are.

989
01:13:24,795 --> 01:13:27,263
What are you gonna do
about it, huh?

990
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:35,003
You've been the big man for a long time,
but you just acted like a child.

991
01:13:35,105 --> 01:13:38,233
So, I want you to pick up
the ticket and go home,

992
01:13:38,342 --> 01:13:42,369
because if you don't, you know exactly
what I'm capable of doing,

993
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:44,277
don't you?

994
01:14:01,532 --> 01:14:02,521
All right, listen up.

995
01:14:02,633 --> 01:14:06,160
Casino's gonna change out their chips,
just like the MGM did after the Tyson fight.

996
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:09,137
That means we got less
than 24 hours to cash in,

997
01:14:09,239 --> 01:14:11,503
or we're gonna be sitting with
200 grand of worthless plastic.

998
01:14:11,608 --> 01:14:13,838
- So, we'll cash out.
- It's too hot.

999
01:14:13,944 --> 01:14:17,846
They're gonna be dissecting the eye in
the sky footage of Fisher's little power play.

1000
01:14:17,948 --> 01:14:20,143
So, let's do it right now
before they can do that.

1001
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:22,218
Are you deliberately slow?

1002
01:14:23,053 --> 01:14:24,611
What about them?

1003
01:14:25,989 --> 01:14:27,547
What about them?

1004
01:14:27,658 --> 01:14:31,958
They can cash in the chips.
The casino's just gonna think they're tips.

1005
01:14:39,403 --> 01:14:40,836
- Cashing out.
- Thank you.

1006
01:14:40,938 --> 01:14:43,031
- Thank you.
- Thanks, sweetie.

1007
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:46,074
- Thanks, hon.
- Thank you, baby.

1008
01:14:50,747 --> 01:14:52,806
I love a parade,
don't you?

1009
01:14:53,984 --> 01:14:57,750
You know, there's a word
I don't throw around all that often,

1010
01:14:58,355 --> 01:14:59,583
"Genius".

1011
01:15:28,085 --> 01:15:31,111
Hey, Kianna. Let me hold
your bag for a second.

1012
01:15:31,822 --> 01:15:33,084
Thanks, baby, here.

1013
01:15:33,190 --> 01:15:34,680
Oh, no problem. Anytime.

1014
01:15:34,791 --> 01:15:37,692
- Watch. Watch, watch. Ready?
- Okay, I'm watching. That's beautiful.

1015
01:15:37,794 --> 01:15:38,783
Watch.

1016
01:15:38,895 --> 01:15:42,626
No, it's great, you just need a little, uh,
to get your knee a little higher.

1017
01:16:04,788 --> 01:16:06,312
- Hi.
- Hey.

1018
01:16:07,691 --> 01:16:10,125
So, the Hard Rock
comped me a suite.

1019
01:16:11,361 --> 01:16:13,329
That's cool, that's great.

1020
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,095
You wanna see it?

1021
01:17:20,464 --> 01:17:23,126
All right, take care, Bobby.
All right?

1022
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:45,144
God, it's cold.

1023
01:17:45,589 --> 01:17:47,489
Hey, what time is it?

1024
01:17:48,458 --> 01:17:51,621
He's only 45 minutes late.
Show a little patience.

1025
01:17:53,029 --> 01:17:55,088
Oh, look.
Here he comes.

1026
01:17:55,899 --> 01:17:57,890
Guys, I'm sorry I'm late.

1027
01:17:58,001 --> 01:17:59,229
Hey, Ben.

1028
01:17:59,503 --> 01:18:01,300
You know, you could try
returning a call once in a while.

1029
01:18:01,405 --> 01:18:03,566
Good of you to show up, man.
It's not like we're cold or anything.

1030
01:18:03,673 --> 01:18:05,038
Yeah, funny.

1031
01:18:06,343 --> 01:18:09,972
- Hey, did you bring it?
- Yeah, I got it. There it is.

1032
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:13,015
And you're sure you didn't inlay
the software on more space

1033
01:18:13,116 --> 01:18:14,310
than the parameters suggest?

1034
01:18:14,418 --> 01:18:16,443
No. It's just one-fifth
of the free face.

1035
01:18:16,553 --> 01:18:18,544
Let's fire this mother up.

1036
01:18:18,655 --> 01:18:19,917
Beautiful.

1037
01:18:28,765 --> 01:18:29,993
Okay.

1038
01:18:30,534 --> 01:18:31,626
Okay.

1039
01:18:35,138 --> 01:18:36,730
What's happening?

1040
01:18:40,076 --> 01:18:42,601
- I don't understand.
- It's the wrong size.

1041
01:18:42,712 --> 01:18:43,974
No. What?

1042
01:18:45,048 --> 01:18:48,347
- What the hell, Ben? This is an 8K.
- Right.

1043
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:51,920
Yeah, we needed 16K!

1044
01:18:53,356 --> 01:18:57,156
I can't believe this.
- I-I thought it was an-an 8K.

1045
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:58,852
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

1046
01:18:58,962 --> 01:19:03,194
No, you didn't. You knew the entire
time the discrete was 16K.

1047
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:04,962
Damn it, Ben.

1048
01:19:05,068 --> 01:19:08,333
It's gonna take us two weeks
to get a fresh 16K from the fabrication.

1049
01:19:08,438 --> 01:19:11,839
And another five days, minimum,
to get it ready to press.

1050
01:19:11,942 --> 01:19:15,378
Miles, calm down, all right?
It was, uh, an honest mistake.

1051
01:19:18,014 --> 01:19:19,311
What?

1052
01:19:21,651 --> 01:19:26,418
You know what? Um, I think we're gonna
have to go at this without you, man.

1053
01:19:27,524 --> 01:19:29,219
You-you're gonna what?

1054
01:19:32,062 --> 01:19:35,657
No, no. This is just
as much mine as it is yours.

1055
01:19:35,765 --> 01:19:38,359
We've been working on this
for over a year.

1056
01:19:38,468 --> 01:19:42,029
I know that. But your heart
just isn't in this anymore.

1057
01:19:47,811 --> 01:19:49,369
You serious?

1058
01:19:56,086 --> 01:19:57,110
Fine.

1059
01:19:58,955 --> 01:20:00,047
Fine.

1060
01:20:01,458 --> 01:20:05,690
You know what? I don't even care.
Honestly, I don't even care.

1061
01:20:05,795 --> 01:20:07,023
You know why?

1062
01:20:07,130 --> 01:20:11,499
'Cause no one in the real world gives
a shit about the 2.09 Competition.

1063
01:20:12,602 --> 01:20:14,467
You know, it's just something
that you build up in your head

1064
01:20:14,571 --> 01:20:16,562
to make yourselves
feel important.

1065
01:20:16,673 --> 01:20:18,573
You guys are pathetic.

1066
01:20:18,675 --> 01:20:19,835
Thanks.

1067
01:20:26,816 --> 01:20:28,215
Welcome back, Mr. Youngman.

1068
01:20:28,318 --> 01:20:32,084
- Thanks, Joseph. It's good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

1069
01:20:35,725 --> 01:20:38,717
Good evening, Mr. Youngman,
welcome back to the Red Rock.

1070
01:20:38,828 --> 01:20:40,295
Nice to see you.

1071
01:20:40,397 --> 01:20:43,059
Anything I can do for you,
let me know.

1072
01:21:00,617 --> 01:21:01,982
Double down.

1073
01:21:37,721 --> 01:21:40,747
I guess you play big
or you don't play at all.

1074
01:21:41,958 --> 01:21:43,186
Right?

1075
01:21:45,695 --> 01:21:49,722
Honey, there you are. Let's go.
We don't wanna miss the show!

1076
01:21:49,833 --> 01:21:52,631
Honey, we're actually
playing a game here.

1077
01:21:53,103 --> 01:21:54,195
Yeah.

1078
01:21:54,604 --> 01:21:56,367
Yeah, so,
you know what?

1079
01:21:56,473 --> 01:22:00,534
Why don't you run upstairs
and, uh, wait for me there? Okay?

1080
01:22:03,146 --> 01:22:04,977
All right. Let's go.

1081
01:22:10,153 --> 01:22:12,144
Yeah, all right.

1082
01:22:12,756 --> 01:22:15,350
I've got the worst
headache right now.

1083
01:22:29,372 --> 01:22:31,203
- Ten.
- Come on, monkey.

1084
01:22:31,307 --> 01:22:33,673
- Fourteen.
- Come on. Come on, monkey.

1085
01:22:33,777 --> 01:22:35,904
- Sixteen.
- Monkey. Come on.

1086
01:22:37,213 --> 01:22:38,646
Twenty-one.

1087
01:22:45,088 --> 01:22:47,022
Pete, you're killing us.

1088
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:02,261
I guess it's not my night.

1089
01:23:27,067 --> 01:23:29,277
Are you out of your mind?

1090
01:23:29,943 --> 01:23:32,725
I, uh, I don't know
what happened.

1091
01:23:33,002 --> 01:23:35,630
I-I messed up.
I'm sorry.

1092
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:38,034
Oh, oh, you're sorry.

1093
01:23:38,141 --> 01:23:41,736
Oh, see, now that's what I've been waiting
to hear, Ben. As long as you're sorry.

1094
01:23:41,845 --> 01:23:46,407
I'm out 200 grand, but Ben's sorry!
Everybody hear that? Ben's sorry!

1095
01:23:46,516 --> 01:23:50,577
So, we can all go back to being
friends and laughing over cocktails!

1096
01:23:51,788 --> 01:23:53,153
Come on, Micky.
It can happen to anyone.

1097
01:23:53,256 --> 01:23:54,689
They get on a rush
and they lose control.

1098
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:56,418
You shut your mouth.
This is business.

1099
01:23:56,526 --> 01:23:59,893
Hey, I let you down,
all right? I get it.

1100
01:23:59,996 --> 01:24:03,830
Excuse me? You let me down?
I don't care!

1101
01:24:04,467 --> 01:24:07,595
Let me make one thing clear to you,
I am not your father!

1102
01:24:07,704 --> 01:24:10,730
You are not my friend.
This is a business.

1103
01:24:11,007 --> 01:24:13,134
You are only as good to me
as the money you make,

1104
01:24:13,243 --> 01:24:14,938
and, right now, it's not
worth a hell of a lot!

1105
01:24:15,044 --> 01:24:16,525
You're gonna give me back
everything you lost.

1106
01:24:16,525 --> 01:24:19,644
No, no, no! I can't do that!
That money was for Harvard!

1107
01:24:19,749 --> 01:24:21,649
I have made you so much more
than what I just lost!

1108
01:24:21,751 --> 01:24:23,582
It doesn't matter, Ben.

1109
01:24:23,686 --> 01:24:26,814
You had very clear instructions,
and you didn't follow them.

1110
01:24:26,923 --> 01:24:30,859
You didn't do your job.
You weren't counting, you were gambling!

1111
01:24:33,396 --> 01:24:36,233
Well, why aren't you
out there, then, Micky? Hmm?

1112
01:24:36,866 --> 01:24:41,565
I mean, we take all the risks.
Seems to me like you don't do shit.

1113
01:24:46,276 --> 01:24:48,210
This isn't about me,

1114
01:24:49,045 --> 01:24:52,742
you arrogant little infant.

1115
01:25:05,662 --> 01:25:08,290
You can all find your own way
back to Boston.

1116
01:25:08,398 --> 01:25:12,459
And, Ben, you're gonna pay me that money,
every penny, one way or the other.

1117
01:25:12,569 --> 01:25:14,560
And you damn well
know it.

1118
01:25:24,647 --> 01:25:26,137
I need a drink.

1119
01:25:28,985 --> 01:25:30,418
Anybody else?

1120
01:25:33,456 --> 01:25:35,185
Yeah, well,
we don't need him.

1121
01:25:35,291 --> 01:25:36,952
- Yeah, okay, Ben.
- No, I'm serious.

1122
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:39,722
Why do we need him?
We have our own money now.

1123
01:25:39,829 --> 01:25:43,094
You know, his cut was 50%,
and he doesn't even play!

1124
01:25:43,666 --> 01:25:44,826
Why do we need him?

1125
01:25:44,934 --> 01:25:46,026
Hey, you know what I think?

1126
01:25:46,135 --> 01:25:49,468
I think we play out the weekend,
and I think we do this without him.

1127
01:25:49,572 --> 01:25:50,971
No. No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

1128
01:25:51,074 --> 01:25:53,304
I think we should go back
to Boston and figure this out.

1129
01:25:53,409 --> 01:25:55,206
Yeah, well, why don't we
let the team decide?

1130
01:25:55,311 --> 01:25:58,439
I'm with Jill. This is Micky's thing.
Micky brought us together.

1131
01:25:58,548 --> 01:26:00,539
And then he drove us apart.

1132
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:03,676
I mean, you saw how
he played Fisher against me.

1133
01:26:04,621 --> 01:26:08,250
Choi, what do you say, man?
You wanna make some money?

1134
01:26:09,759 --> 01:26:11,420
- Kind of.
- Really?

1135
01:26:12,195 --> 01:26:15,460
We need 100 grand just to play.
You're talking about risking our own money.

1136
01:26:15,565 --> 01:26:17,062
All I'm saying is
that we try it.

1137
01:26:18,014 --> 01:26:22,635
You know, if... we make the investment,
then we take all of the winnings.

1138
01:26:23,706 --> 01:26:25,003
All of it.

1139
01:26:32,148 --> 01:26:33,445
Okay.

1140
01:26:37,754 --> 01:26:38,812
Yeah.

1141
01:26:39,289 --> 01:26:41,348
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1142
01:26:43,092 --> 01:26:44,286
Choi?

1143
01:26:45,662 --> 01:26:46,924
I'm in.

1144
01:26:48,798 --> 01:26:50,493
Now I need a drink.

1145
01:26:56,472 --> 01:26:58,235
- What are you doing?
- What?

1146
01:26:58,341 --> 01:27:00,309
What are you doing?

1147
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:02,469
Well, we're printing money.

1148
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:05,608
What, you think just 'cause Micky
left we're gonna stop?

1149
01:27:05,715 --> 01:27:08,513
No, I could do this.
I can lead this team.

1150
01:27:08,885 --> 01:27:12,150
You know, I'm not the same guy
I was back in Boston.

1151
01:27:12,622 --> 01:27:14,852
- Exactly.
- Yeah, exactly.

1152
01:27:15,358 --> 01:27:17,986
You know, isn't this exactly
who you wanted me to be

1153
01:27:18,094 --> 01:27:21,086
when you first came into
the store to buy a tie?

1154
01:27:25,368 --> 01:27:28,607
What happened to
"300,000 dollars and I'm out"? Hmm?

1155
01:27:28,972 --> 01:27:31,668
What happened to
"A means to an end"?

1156
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:35,441
How much do you have?
- What?

1157
01:27:35,545 --> 01:27:37,740
- How much do you have?
- I got enough.

1158
01:27:37,847 --> 01:27:40,077
Come on, Ben. How much do you
have saved back in Boston?

1159
01:27:40,183 --> 01:27:42,708
I've got 315 grand,
all right?

1160
01:27:43,086 --> 01:27:45,384
Then why are you still here?

1161
01:27:46,723 --> 01:27:50,682
Because I wanna still be here.
I like being here.

1162
01:27:51,127 --> 01:27:52,992
So does everybody else.

1163
01:27:53,396 --> 01:27:56,092
So, come on, Jill.
Are you in?

1164
01:28:01,971 --> 01:28:04,735
You are the big player, Ben.

1165
01:28:04,841 --> 01:28:06,206
Yes, I am.

1166
01:28:08,644 --> 01:28:10,544
Yeah, can I get a drink?

1167
01:28:38,474 --> 01:28:40,408
Rose, I wanna thank you.

1168
01:28:41,444 --> 01:28:43,810
You have been
most accommodating.

1169
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:46,348
All right, that's for you.

1170
01:28:46,649 --> 01:28:48,947
Okay, take care.
Hey, good luck.

1171
01:28:56,526 --> 01:28:58,517
Hey, how we doing here, people?

1172
01:29:09,839 --> 01:29:13,240
Yeah, I'm gonna put you on hold
while I track him down.

1173
01:29:16,846 --> 01:29:18,973
Just got an interesting call.

1174
01:29:21,084 --> 01:29:25,145
There's nobody left to fire us.
Planet Hollywood is our last client.

1175
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:29,490
I don't know about that.

1176
01:29:35,131 --> 01:29:36,564
This is Cole.

1177
01:29:46,112 --> 01:29:50,141
Ahh, queen of diamonds.
Your lady luck tonight.

1178
01:29:50,646 --> 01:29:52,273
You're doing good.

1179
01:29:52,582 --> 01:29:54,345
You're a real winner.

1180
01:29:59,122 --> 01:30:01,818
Sometimes.
Just like everybody else.

1181
01:30:02,892 --> 01:30:05,087
Now, why don't I believe that?

1182
01:30:07,196 --> 01:30:09,255
Maybe you're just smarter
than everybody else, huh?

1183
01:30:09,365 --> 01:30:12,027
Yeah, I bet it's been
that way your entire life.

1184
01:30:12,135 --> 01:30:15,901
Except it just recently started
paying dividends, am I right?

1185
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:19,005
I'd split them.

1186
01:30:19,108 --> 01:30:23,545
Deck's heavy as hell and since
I've been here, the true count's at plus 7.

1187
01:30:30,353 --> 01:30:32,446
Kianna. I think we have
a serious problem over there.

1188
01:30:32,555 --> 01:30:34,022
- Walk now!
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

1189
01:30:34,123 --> 01:30:37,183
Let's go. I'm out. Thank you.
Let's go, Jill. Let's go.

1190
01:30:37,293 --> 01:30:39,022
I think we need to call
security or something.

1191
01:30:39,128 --> 01:30:42,723
Yeah, I don't think they're gonna help.
Let's go! Come on.

1192
01:30:47,336 --> 01:30:49,304
Let's take a walk, huh?

1193
01:30:50,039 --> 01:30:53,805
Come on, kid. See if we can't
get you that chicken dinner.

1194
01:30:58,981 --> 01:31:01,575
It's called, uh,
biometrics.

1195
01:31:01,684 --> 01:31:05,916
Biometrics. It's sort of like,
uh, a fingerprint of your face.

1196
01:31:08,558 --> 01:31:13,791
See, when the player sits down at
the table, the software, it reads this, uh...

1197
01:31:13,896 --> 01:31:15,363
Biometric profile.

1198
01:31:15,464 --> 01:31:17,227
... biometric profile
of your face,

1199
01:31:17,333 --> 01:31:20,359
cross-references it
with a database of counters.

1200
01:31:23,906 --> 01:31:28,707
Software'll probably put you and me
out of business, but it still can't do this.

1201
01:31:31,881 --> 01:31:33,178
All right.

1202
01:31:37,323 --> 01:31:41,621
Ohh! You understand
all this. You go to MIT.

1203
01:31:41,991 --> 01:31:43,390
Smart boy.

1204
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:46,794
My name is Cole Williams.

1205
01:31:47,396 --> 01:31:50,661
And if I ever see you
in this town again,

1206
01:31:51,434 --> 01:31:54,835
I will break your cheek bone
with a small hammer,

1207
01:31:56,072 --> 01:31:58,063
and then I will kill you.

1208
01:32:02,745 --> 01:32:06,306
Please. Please,
just take the money.

1209
01:32:07,550 --> 01:32:09,074
You can take it.

1210
01:32:11,787 --> 01:32:13,118
Tell me, uh,

1211
01:32:13,689 --> 01:32:18,422
how's... good old
Professor Rosa doing, huh?

1212
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:24,692
Oh, yeah. Me and Micky,
we go way back.

1213
01:32:25,801 --> 01:32:28,793
I spent years, chased him
all over this town.

1214
01:32:29,238 --> 01:32:34,198
Giving him beat downs left and right,
only to find him at the tables a week later.

1215
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:36,278
He was very persistent.

1216
01:32:37,179 --> 01:32:40,478
And then, one September night,

1217
01:32:40,983 --> 01:32:43,884
when I was in Barstow
at my father's funeral,

1218
01:32:44,754 --> 01:32:48,190
my casino was taken
for seven figures.

1219
01:32:48,291 --> 01:32:49,622
Can you imagine that?

1220
01:32:49,725 --> 01:32:52,956
The most ever taken by
a single counter in one night.

1221
01:32:53,062 --> 01:32:57,658
'Course I was, naturally,
unceremoniously fired.

1222
01:33:00,369 --> 01:33:02,132
Funny thing, though.

1223
01:33:02,538 --> 01:33:05,063
I never saw Micky Rosa
after that.

1224
01:33:06,242 --> 01:33:07,368
Never.

1225
01:34:34,096 --> 01:34:36,223
Cauchy was the first
to make a rigorous study

1226
01:34:36,332 --> 01:34:40,359
of the conditions for convergence
of an infinite series.

1227
01:34:40,469 --> 01:34:42,767
And was concerned with developing

1228
01:34:42,872 --> 01:34:47,741
the basic theorems of the calculus
as rigorously as possible.

1229
01:34:49,145 --> 01:34:50,578
Any questions?

1230
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:53,107
No? All right, moving on.

1231
01:34:54,150 --> 01:34:58,143
Isn't it true Cauchy
stole from his students?

1232
01:35:03,058 --> 01:35:06,926
Yes, I heard that.
What's your theory on that?

1233
01:35:07,963 --> 01:35:12,491
They say he used his students
for their brilliance,

1234
01:35:13,636 --> 01:35:17,868
then discredited them
and stole their equations,

1235
01:35:19,942 --> 01:35:21,807
stole their hard work.

1236
01:35:24,513 --> 01:35:27,209
Well, that wouldn't be the first time
a teacher was accused of that.

1237
01:35:27,316 --> 01:35:32,015
I think what he's referring to
is Vladimir Stupnitsky, yes?

1238
01:35:32,121 --> 01:35:35,056
He was a student of Cauchy's
who accused Cauchy

1239
01:35:35,157 --> 01:35:38,490
of stealing his four-volume text
on this analysis

1240
01:35:38,594 --> 01:35:41,062
and publishing it
under a pseudonym.

1241
01:35:42,898 --> 01:35:44,559
Of course, nobody knows
what really went down there.

1242
01:35:44,667 --> 01:35:48,660
They never did prove it, and without
the proof, it's a little like it never happened.

1243
01:35:48,771 --> 01:35:50,796
And, you know,
it's a real shame,

1244
01:35:50,906 --> 01:35:55,104
because if Stupnitsky had just realized
that he shouldn't have crossed Cauchy,

1245
01:35:55,211 --> 01:35:56,940
this was the dispute,

1246
01:35:57,980 --> 01:36:03,976
if he'd been able to... get beyond some
of the personal mistakes that were made,

1247
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:07,751
I have no doubt that Cauchy
would have worked with him again,

1248
01:36:07,857 --> 01:36:10,883
and they could have
done great things together.

1249
01:36:11,293 --> 01:36:15,354
But, as history shows us,
some students never learn.

1250
01:36:17,066 --> 01:36:18,727
You should get
that eye looked at.

1251
01:36:55,938 --> 01:36:57,337
You okay?

1252
01:37:00,309 --> 01:37:01,936
Everything's gone.

1253
01:37:03,746 --> 01:37:06,340
- What?
- Micky's taken everything.

1254
01:37:06,448 --> 01:37:10,680
He's taken the money,
taken away Harvard Med, even MIT.

1255
01:37:12,555 --> 01:37:14,648
- What are you talking about?
- Micky, he's taken everything.

1256
01:37:14,757 --> 01:37:17,157
I-I-I gotta find a way
to get it back.

1257
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:19,950
Are you insane?

1258
01:37:20,563 --> 01:37:24,124
You just got the shit kicked out
of you and you won't let this go!

1259
01:37:24,233 --> 01:37:28,169
Look, what am I supposed to do, Jill?
I've just lost everything!

1260
01:37:28,938 --> 01:37:30,428
Look, please...

1261
01:37:32,241 --> 01:37:34,505
I don't wanna lose you, too.

1262
01:37:37,513 --> 01:37:41,108
Ben, you were
dragged away in Vegas.

1263
01:37:41,784 --> 01:37:46,118
I haven't heard from you.
I had no idea where you were.

1264
01:37:46,822 --> 01:37:48,050
I know.

1265
01:37:49,024 --> 01:37:50,184
I know.

1266
01:37:57,533 --> 01:38:00,331
You know, I'm so sorry
that I hurt you.

1267
01:38:02,137 --> 01:38:03,502
I'm sorry.

1268
01:38:06,375 --> 01:38:10,869
In Vegas, I don't know
what happened. That wasn't me.

1269
01:38:12,081 --> 01:38:13,708
Look, you know me.

1270
01:38:14,416 --> 01:38:16,281
You know what I'm like.

1271
01:38:18,087 --> 01:38:19,577
You know me.

1272
01:38:26,028 --> 01:38:27,893
I need you to trust me.

1273
01:38:29,231 --> 01:38:32,598
<i>And the winner of this year's 2.09</i>

1274
01:38:32,701 --> 01:38:38,970
<i>for excellence in the field of robotics
goes to the team of Connolly and Kazazi!</i>

1275
01:39:16,345 --> 01:39:19,314
That's it. That's...
that's the story.

1276
01:39:21,817 --> 01:39:24,047
Jill Taylor. Really?

1277
01:39:24,853 --> 01:39:28,345
- Yeah. Yeah, really.
- Wow.

1278
01:39:28,457 --> 01:39:32,655
Yeah, it doesn't feel like "wow," Miles.
I really screwed up.

1279
01:39:32,761 --> 01:39:37,494
Yeah, you did.
But... you had a life experience.

1280
01:39:41,937 --> 01:39:43,928
I-I can't believe
how I treated you, Miles.

1281
01:39:44,039 --> 01:39:47,941
You know, you're my best friend,
and I... really let you down.

1282
01:39:48,811 --> 01:39:51,905
I really let you down.
I'm sorry.

1283
01:39:53,716 --> 01:39:58,244
And I'm-I'm happy for you, you know?
Winning the 2.09? That's... that's great.

1284
01:39:59,621 --> 01:40:02,089
- Jill Taylor, really?!
- Yeah.

1285
01:40:04,626 --> 01:40:06,719
So, let me get
this straight.

1286
01:40:07,396 --> 01:40:10,559
Money, girls,

1287
01:40:11,734 --> 01:40:16,137
high-roller suites,
clubs, Vegas.

1288
01:40:17,339 --> 01:40:22,367
Yeah, I think I probably would have
blown off the 2.09 Competition, too.

1289
01:40:25,914 --> 01:40:27,279
So, we cool?

1290
01:40:28,917 --> 01:40:30,509
Yeah, we're cool.

1291
01:40:31,019 --> 01:40:33,715
But you better believe that you're
gonna make this up to me big time.

1292
01:40:33,822 --> 01:40:35,084
All right.

1293
01:40:36,391 --> 01:40:38,518
So, what are you
gonna do now?

1294
01:41:29,311 --> 01:41:31,142
What do you want, Ben?
This is an alumni dinner.

1295
01:41:31,246 --> 01:41:33,612
You need a diploma
to come to one of these.

1296
01:41:33,715 --> 01:41:36,115
Wait. Stupnitsky wants back in.

1297
01:41:42,324 --> 01:41:43,291
What?

1298
01:41:43,392 --> 01:41:47,522
Look, I... I've... I've had some time
to think about what you said.

1299
01:41:49,398 --> 01:41:50,888
I want back in.

1300
01:41:51,867 --> 01:41:55,735
- Why now?
- Because I have nothing else.

1301
01:41:57,606 --> 01:42:00,803
All right, look, Ben. I'm not gonna lie to you.
You're good, you're very, very good.

1302
01:42:00,909 --> 01:42:05,073
But you did exactly what I told you not to.
You got emotional and then you got stupid.

1303
01:42:05,180 --> 01:42:08,877
Now you tell me why in the world
I'd ever get back in business with you.

1304
01:42:08,984 --> 01:42:13,444
Look, I know I should never have
disrespected you, all right? I know that.

1305
01:42:14,423 --> 01:42:16,391
With this facial
recognition software,

1306
01:42:16,491 --> 01:42:19,688
our window of opportunity
is closing in on us.

1307
01:42:20,229 --> 01:42:23,892
Now, I need this, Micky.
I really, really need this.

1308
01:42:23,999 --> 01:42:29,130
Well, the take would have to be really, really
good to get me even vaguely interested.

1309
01:42:30,639 --> 01:42:35,941
Well, you know, that's... that's why I was
thinking maybe you should be the other big player.

1310
01:42:37,346 --> 01:42:40,679
You know,
two big players playing big?

1311
01:42:41,850 --> 01:42:45,183
Hey, slow down,
I haven't played in a long time, Ben.

1312
01:42:49,625 --> 01:42:51,217
But Fisher's out.

1313
01:42:52,094 --> 01:42:56,463
No one else on the team
can... be the big player, can they?

1314
01:42:59,701 --> 01:43:03,102
And if we do well,
if we do really well,

1315
01:43:03,872 --> 01:43:07,035
then you get your grades back,
get to Harvard Med,

1316
01:43:08,043 --> 01:43:10,568
and I might even
get that sabbatical.

1317
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:16,040
Well, amazing things can be done
from the inside, right?

1318
01:43:17,986 --> 01:43:20,682
Just went back to
the head of the class.

1319
01:43:21,957 --> 01:43:23,822
I gotta go be social.

1320
01:43:29,197 --> 01:43:32,496
All right, now listen.
It's different out there this time.

1321
01:43:32,601 --> 01:43:35,468
The stakes are high
and it's more dangerous.

1322
01:43:36,004 --> 01:43:39,064
But the return...
is gonna be the biggest.

1323
01:43:40,375 --> 01:43:43,811
Now, they know our faces,
so we're gonna wear disguises.

1324
01:43:44,046 --> 01:43:46,014
And we can't mess around.

1325
01:43:46,381 --> 01:43:47,848
I'm glad you're
back with us, Micky.

1326
01:43:47,950 --> 01:43:49,850
Well, I couldn't let you guys
come back to this town

1327
01:43:49,952 --> 01:43:53,444
and not prove to Ben that
I can do more than just teach.

1328
01:43:54,289 --> 01:43:58,191
But as we've all said, this game
is about the past and the future,

1329
01:43:58,293 --> 01:44:01,353
and tonight
we forget about the past.

1330
01:44:01,596 --> 01:44:03,461
We just focus on the future.

1331
01:44:03,565 --> 01:44:06,898
Right. This is our last time.

1332
01:44:07,302 --> 01:44:10,328
Now, we all know the drill if things get ugly.
We meet at the Fox Strip Club.

1333
01:44:10,439 --> 01:44:12,771
Nobody leaves this town alone.

1334
01:44:16,244 --> 01:44:18,144
Let's go make a killing.

1335
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:20,045
All right.

1336
01:44:42,170 --> 01:44:44,638
Let's see what we can do with this.

1337
01:44:53,749 --> 01:44:57,810
Seems like I'm having one of those days,
you know what I mean, Jim?

1338
01:44:59,488 --> 01:45:01,615
I'm bringing all the luck today.
I'm just bringing it all.

1339
01:45:01,723 --> 01:45:06,183
Anyone who's in any kind of contact
with me is getting so much luck today.

1340
01:45:17,839 --> 01:45:20,000
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner! There it is.

1341
01:45:20,108 --> 01:45:23,544
Thank you. God, I love this town.
I love this game.

1342
01:45:24,346 --> 01:45:27,645
And, Jim, I might
even love you.

1343
01:45:37,459 --> 01:45:39,654
Hey, you mind if I sit down?

1344
01:45:53,675 --> 01:45:54,733
What's your name?

1345
01:45:54,843 --> 01:45:57,971
Shane? I'm about to change your luck.
It's gonna become mine.

1346
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:00,310
There you go,
give me it all.

1347
01:46:10,358 --> 01:46:11,552
There you go.

1348
01:46:14,329 --> 01:46:16,092
Thank you. Thank you.

1349
01:46:20,836 --> 01:46:23,066
Such a shame, Shane!

1350
01:46:24,039 --> 01:46:26,098
Okay, I'm supposed to double, right?

1351
01:46:26,208 --> 01:46:30,542
- Is this your first time, darling?
- I've been winning and losing for hours.

1352
01:46:30,645 --> 01:46:32,738
Well, that's all right.
I've been winning and losing for years.

1353
01:46:46,061 --> 01:46:47,585
What the hell kind of streak
are you on, boy?

1354
01:46:47,696 --> 01:46:50,358
This never happens,
this never happens.

1355
01:47:03,411 --> 01:47:05,208
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.

1356
01:47:05,313 --> 01:47:06,871
- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens!

1357
01:47:06,982 --> 01:47:08,116
- Split tens!
- Again!

1358
01:47:08,116 --> 01:47:08,844
- Split tens!
- Again!

1359
01:47:31,773 --> 01:47:34,742
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Give me the chips, Blanca.

1360
01:47:35,977 --> 01:47:37,842
Give me the chips!
Come on, give me the chips, Blanca.

1361
01:47:37,946 --> 01:47:40,847
Come on,
just give me the chips!

1362
01:47:40,949 --> 01:47:45,079
- My bus has to leave right away.
- I gotta walk my dog.

1363
01:47:45,187 --> 01:47:47,747
- I'm sorry we're making such a mess.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

1364
01:47:47,856 --> 01:47:50,916
Nice to see you.
Have a good night, darling.

1365
01:47:56,464 --> 01:47:57,761
This way!

1366
01:48:08,977 --> 01:48:10,069
Go.

1367
01:48:24,426 --> 01:48:25,791
This way!

1368
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:33,691
Come on, Jill.
Come on!

1369
01:48:43,612 --> 01:48:46,206
Go that way. Throw me the chips.
Come on, we gotta separate.

1370
01:48:46,314 --> 01:48:49,181
Give me the chips,
I'll meet you at Fox's.

1371
01:48:55,257 --> 01:48:56,849
Go, go, go, go!

1372
01:49:07,802 --> 01:49:09,463
Come on, come on.

1373
01:49:12,574 --> 01:49:14,132
Move, move, move!

1374
01:49:18,313 --> 01:49:19,575
Come on.

1375
01:49:20,715 --> 01:49:22,307
Go, go, this way.

1376
01:49:34,296 --> 01:49:36,127
All right, let's go.

1377
01:49:44,205 --> 01:49:46,696
Go, go, go, go!
Airport!

1378
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:06,887
<i>I never saw Micky Rosa
after that.</i>

1379
01:50:11,966 --> 01:50:13,228
Oh, God.

1380
01:50:14,336 --> 01:50:16,600
But I think
I wanna see him now.

1381
01:50:17,672 --> 01:50:20,140
And I want you
to make that happen.

1382
01:50:24,412 --> 01:50:26,846
I-I don't work
for Micky anymore.

1383
01:50:29,851 --> 01:50:31,284
Come on, kid.

1384
01:50:33,121 --> 01:50:36,887
Your picture's all over the database.
Your Vegas gig is done.

1385
01:50:37,926 --> 01:50:39,860
But I will give you
one night.

1386
01:50:39,961 --> 01:50:43,021
And I can guarantee
that you won't be bothered.

1387
01:50:43,932 --> 01:50:47,698
You'll make a killing,
and you'll keep it all.

1388
01:50:50,772 --> 01:50:51,966
Listen.

1389
01:50:53,541 --> 01:50:55,008
My name's Cole.

1390
01:50:56,578 --> 01:50:58,102
Cole Williams.

1391
01:51:00,014 --> 01:51:02,414
You just bring me
Micky Rosa, kid.

1392
01:51:02,717 --> 01:51:04,742
I'll take care of the rest.

1393
01:51:07,288 --> 01:51:10,223
Son of a bitch.

1394
01:51:52,867 --> 01:51:54,630
Who the hell are you?

1395
01:52:17,492 --> 01:52:20,655
Ben. Good job.

1396
01:52:21,729 --> 01:52:26,792
You'll be glad to know I'm gonna have a talk
with your professor, and that MIT thing?

1397
01:52:27,001 --> 01:52:29,094
It's gonna
work out for you.

1398
01:52:30,672 --> 01:52:32,230
So, that's it?

1399
01:52:33,675 --> 01:52:36,439
- That's it.
- All right.

1400
01:52:37,412 --> 01:52:39,107
Oh, dr. Campbell?

1401
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:43,417
They don't have pensions
in my line of work.

1402
01:52:43,751 --> 01:52:45,651
And the software does
what it's supposed to do.

1403
01:52:45,753 --> 01:52:49,655
And I been chasing Micky Rosa
around here for too damn long.

1404
01:52:50,892 --> 01:52:53,156
I'm looking at
some retirement.

1405
01:52:55,063 --> 01:52:56,530
Leave the bag.

1406
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:00,898
No. No, no, no, no.

1407
01:53:01,002 --> 01:53:05,496
I need this money. You have no idea
what I went through to get this money.

1408
01:53:05,607 --> 01:53:10,601
I know, kid, but you're gonna figure out
how to get everything you want in this life,

1409
01:53:10,712 --> 01:53:12,441
'cause you're smart.

1410
01:53:14,015 --> 01:53:18,543
So, you're gonna
leave the bag.

1411
01:53:23,591 --> 01:53:28,187
Ben, give him the bag. Give him the bag.
It doesn't matter. Give him the bag.

1412
01:53:37,038 --> 01:53:38,835
I knew you were smart.

1413
01:53:57,692 --> 01:54:00,422
<i>I had a 1590 on my SAT.</i>

1414
01:54:00,528 --> 01:54:02,587
<i>I got a 44 on my MCATs.</i>

1415
01:54:03,097 --> 01:54:06,225
<i>And I have
a 4.0 GPA from MIT.</i>

1416
01:54:06,334 --> 01:54:08,802
<i>I thought I had
my life mapped out.</i>

1417
01:54:10,705 --> 01:54:11,797
<i>But then I remembered</i>

1418
01:54:11,906 --> 01:54:15,364
<i>what my Nonlinear Equations
professor once told me,</i>

1419
01:54:15,910 --> 01:54:19,141
<i>"Always account
for variable change."</i>

1420
01:54:20,949 --> 01:54:22,473
Hello, Micky.

1421
01:54:24,185 --> 01:54:26,016
Look, I got money in Boston.
A hundred grand.

1422
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:28,145
I'll give it to you.
Just let me walk away. I'll walk away.

1423
01:54:28,256 --> 01:54:31,316
I don't want your money,
Micky. I don't need it.

1424
01:54:37,131 --> 01:54:39,929
But I know someone
who might be interested.

1425
01:54:40,301 --> 01:54:44,397
He's good with numbers, too.
He works for the IRS.

1426
01:54:53,214 --> 01:54:55,273
<i>I let down my good friends.</i>

1427
01:54:55,950 --> 01:55:00,887
<i>But as it turns out, they weren't
too bad at simple math either.</i>

1428
01:55:26,714 --> 01:55:29,274
<i>I scored the prettiest girl
in school.</i>

1429
01:55:32,754 --> 01:55:35,382
<i>I got beaten down
by an old-school Vegas thug</i>

1430
01:55:35,490 --> 01:55:38,687
<i>who was having trouble
accepting his retirement.</i>

1431
01:55:39,994 --> 01:55:43,760
<i>But I worked out a deal with him
that got him a nice pension.</i>

1432
01:55:47,135 --> 01:55:49,933
<i>And... I lied to my mother.</i>

1433
01:55:50,405 --> 01:55:54,102
<i>But I confessed the lie,
and, well, she still loved me.</i>

1434
01:56:10,625 --> 01:56:13,890
<i>So, my senior year of college,
I joined this team.</i>

1435
01:56:14,295 --> 01:56:16,456
<i>And I learned
this new skill.</i>

1436
01:56:16,698 --> 01:56:19,724
<i>I went to Vegas
17 times to use it.</i>

1437
01:56:21,903 --> 01:56:25,430
<i>I made hundreds of thousands
of dollars counting cards.</i>

1438
01:56:26,474 --> 01:56:29,034
And then I had it all stolen from me.

1439
01:56:29,977 --> 01:56:31,137
Twice.

1440
01:56:32,447 --> 01:56:36,543
How's that for life experience,
professor? Did I dazzle you?

1441
01:56:37,719 --> 01:56:40,557
Did I... jump off the page?
